My belief is to not judge others on appearances. Many people “judge a book by its cover”, but it is important in life not to do that. Growing up, during school and out of school, I was taught to not judge someone by the way they look. Someone may look a certain way but their personality is what really matters.
When I went on a mission trip with my church, we went to Lynn, Massachusetts. The town had a high poverty rate. The locals were very welcoming and had a positive attitude. When people see homeless people, they may walk away but many do not take the time to get to know their story. I volunteered at a soup kitchen during the trip, and had to sit with the guests and have conversations. I thought they would not want to converse much, but many wanted to share their stories. This is not something I would have normally done and I am glad for such a wonderful experience. 
Entering college has also taught me not to judge someone on appearances. Every day is a new opportunity to meet new people and that can only happen if you have an open mind. You never know who may end up becoming your closest friends. There may be many people who judge based on looks, and they are close minded because that is not what is really important. I have made friends with who I never thought I could approach. Taking the first step and introducing yourself is key to letting people know who you really are.

I believe that the major medical companies and heads of the medical communities in America are corrupt. I believe that the people of America are lied to and live their everyday lives without seeming to care or bringing this issue to attention. It is sad to say/believe that those who are supposed to be creating medicines and advances in the medical field in order to help protect and save the lives of people do not as much care about the health of the people rather their incomes and the money that they will make. For example, I completely believe that there is, or could be, a treatment that could get rid of cancer, maybe not completely, however, the technological advances and intelligence of humans could find a treatment that nearly gets rid of cancer or other diseases/disabilities that do not require supplements. The medical community, especially those in high positions such as medical company heads, earn way more money by providing medications/treatments that people are required to take daily and have to continue to buy throughout their life if they want to suppress their disability or illness rather than providing such people with medications that may possibly get rid of the illness completely or for a longer span of time. This belief is along the same lines of which a lighting company could easily make light bulbs that never burn out or last a significant amount of time longer than those of which that are available to buy. However, if this were to be created people would not have to buy the product as much which would result in much less income for those companies. In this case, an example would be the treatment of someone with anxiety. Rather than developing something that could possibly get rid of the person’s anxiety or a drug that suppresses the anxiety much longer, it is much more profitable for medical companies to make a drug that only lasts for a limited time which means that this person is forced to continually buy the drug in order to prevent the anxiety in this case. I wish to someday find a way to fix this problem and I believe that if I am not able too, one day someone will be able to fix the corruption and care more about the people and the health of the nation, even the world, and make treatments that help rid illnesses instead of minor medications that are designed to suppress the illness in order to make more money for themselves. Of course, it is much easier said than done as a bystander, however, I think that there are more than enough capable people that will realize the health of themselves and others are more important than earning more money than they could possibly spend. I have believed this idea and have been upset by the corruption for as long as I began to take an interest in health sciences. This also helped me to realize that what I would love to do for a career would be to dedicate my life to helping others and developing the health of people around the world.

My life revolves around my family values and my core beliefs. As a child my parents taught me one of my biggest beliefs in life which is, nothing is ever handed to you, you have to work hard and earn everything. Which is where going to college and getting a degree comes into play. Growing up, my parents instilled the idea that my siblings and I had to get a degree, didn’t matter for what, but had to go to college; it wasn’t an option. Growing up in an environment where you are fully aware of everything going on in your household, the struggle of having a single mother with a low income. I was forced to mature fast and realize what the real world was about and I began to believe that a higher education would help me avoid the things my mother went through. It taught me to fully understand the concept of life, how in order to get what I want, I have to work hard for it because I know nobody’s just going to hand it to me. As a little girl I adjusted my mind on doing good in school so I can get into the schools I wanted. Since my family didn’t have money, I went to public school from kindergarten through my senior year of high school. But since I had to attend public school, I worked hard to get into the best ones of them. For middle school, I worked my butt off in elementary school to score high on my kneecaps because my mom told me she wanted me in the gifted program at Nathanael Greene Middle School in Providence, Rhode Island. Once I got into the gifted program I couldn’t stop there, I had to work even more hard because I needed to go to Classical High School, I worked so hard to get into that school. There are limited spots and a long exam you have to take, but I achieved those goals. The older I get, I begin to realize where I want to be in life, there is hundreds of stairs leading to it, but several thousand people in the way competing with me trying to get that one spot. I have worked very hard not only to make my mother happy and proud but to get to the place where I can support myself and her and not go through the struggle, she has to go through due to the fact she never finished college when she was my age. Getting accepted into the University of Rhode Island is only the beginning. At the University I know I am going to have to challenge myself even more and make an impact. Living by this one belief, I feel I can accomplish anything I put my mind to and any future goals I set for myself because after all, the work you put in, is the work that’s going to benefit you.","100000102"

I believe in the existence and the many forms of love.  When I was in high school, I had a boyfriend who told me that I didn’t even know what love was and that I shouldn’t just toss the word about.  Of course, I had never claimed that I was in love with him, only that there was potential that I might fall in love with him.  Needless to say, that relationship was short lived. Yet his comment has stayed with me and the definition of love is something that I think a lot about.  I have come to believe that love does not have a universal definition.  No two people experience it in the same way.  A feeling that one person might interpret as love another might cast off as simply a strong liking. There are also many, many forms of love.  For example, the love that you feel for a parent or even a best friend is different from the love you might feel for a significant other.  One might argue that the love you might have for your parents is inborn; you don’t fall in love.  There is another kind of love that I am especially familiar with.  When I was younger, I struggled with learning to read.  Nothing seemed to click with me, and I suffered in school because of it.  But when I was nine years old, I fell in love with a boy and everything about him.  Some say that Harry Potter and the magical world in which he lives is pure fantasy, but to me it has always been so much more.  Harry Potter is the reason I fell in love with reading, a love that has shaped me into the person I am today.  It may not be a physical love, but that does not make it an any less enduring one.
	 Love exists in all different ways, and it is one thing I believe we should never judge or frown upon.  If a man is in love with another man, then that love is real for him and it is not anyone’s place to decide that it isn’t.  Like my ex-boyfriend, we are so quick to judge others that we don’t see love for what it truly is- beautiful and unique.  Upon accepting his Tony award for Best Score for his musical Hamilton, playwright Lin-Manuel Miranda phrased my belief best: “…And love is love is love is love is love is love is love is love, cannot be killed or swept aside.” The way he repeats his phrase so many times emphasizes the truth of it.  In a world that can seem so full of hate, love is the golden light that cuts through the darkness.  It brings us together and it shines on, even as others try to push it away or cast a shadow of shame on it.  It will continue to exist so long as we believe in it.  It will continue to be unique and powerful even as others doubt it.  Love is love.  That is what I truly believe.","100000103"

I believe that people deserve to be happy and that no one deserves to be depressed. I believe that people should be able to wake up in the morning and have a positive outlook on the day ahead of them. That they should go through their day knowing that their life matters and that there are people that love them and care about them. I strongly believe this because I know what it feels like to wake up in the morning and be debilitated by sadness and depression, to go through the day believing that it wouldn’t matter if I just disappeared or dropped off the face of the earth. I wouldn’t wish those feelings on my worst enemy.  Although I realize that there are bigger problems in the world, such as world hunger, racism, and sexism, it would be a huge step forward for humanity if everyone realized their worth and people didn’t have to deal with depression. Granted, happiness comes in different forms for different people. And everyone has their own idea of happiness, what tends to make me happy does not necessarily have to make, for example, my roommates or my mom happy. We as people find different things to be enjoyable.  I do believe that everyone has the right to be happy but I also believe that that right could be stripped away. For example, if Dave’s idea of happiness is him depriving someone else of their right to happiness, then Dave no longer deserves the right to be happy however Dave does not deserve to be depressed. 
	Depression is a horrible illness that effects an enormous amount of the human population. It is a frightening mental illness because it is a person turning on themselves, and not seeing their worth. People that suffer from depression show many different symptoms which can include but is not limited to anxiety, hopelessness, loss of interest or pleasure in activities, mood swings, excessive hunger, loss of appetite, and restlessness. And different people deal with depression in different ways such as self-harm, self-starvation, suicide or a search or cry for help. 
      In my case, the depression was underlying, but the loss of my grandmother pushed me past my breaking point. In the beginning didn’t tell anyone about the depression for a while, I turned to self-harm, but quickly realized that I couldn’t continue hurting myself and that I need to seek help. I reached out to my mom for help and we decided that it would be best for me to see a professional therapist. Luckily for me the meetings with the therapist was effective. I was able to pull myself out of the depression, although I am still working on myself.
       Going through the depression helped me grow as a person, but my hope is that people won’t have to go through that to realize that they mean so much to the people around them. ","100000104"

I believe that as a person, I should always help others to the best of my abilities. Ever since I was little, I knew that I wanted to be a doctor. To this day, I can’t decide on the type of concentration I plan on specializing in but I always knew one thing; I wanted to help people.  I came from a place where there isn’t much medical help, especially for the poor. In Cape Verde, I saw children and even elders dying of diseases that could have been cured if there were only a better care. This pushed me. Seeing this made me want to become somebody who could make a change in the life of those who lost hope. This motivated me, I knew the only way I could achieve this goal was if I studied. 
My parents were living in the United States while I was still living in Cape Verde. They sent me so clothes, shoes, toys, and whatever else they felt I needed. However, I had a neighbor my age, who was the youngest of 8. She wore clothes her older sister was wearing when she was her age. Every time she saw my clothes she was impressed. Although I appreciated what I had, I knew there were others out there that could use it more than me. One day, I decided to pack a bag full of clothes, I didn’t care if it was even one of my favorite shirts or pants, I just packed it as fast as I could. I was scared my aunt would see me. I snuck the bag out of my house, and brought it to my friend. Although I was fairly young at the time, around the age of 6, it was probably one of the best things I believe I have ever done for someone. She was so happy. 
Later that day, her mother called my aunt to thank her for all the clothes she sent. I didn’t know her mother made the call until my aunt called me into the house and shut the door. The door was always open. When I saw her shut it, I knew she found out. After a long painful beating and many tears later, I went to my aunt and hugged her. Even though I was still in pain, I laid on her and told her I would do it again if I went back. To this day I still feel like I did the right thing. I helped someone who I felt was in need of my help. I learned to appreciate what I have at such a young age. There were many other who were less fortunate, although I couldn’t help all of them, I felt good that I was able to help at least one. I still believe that helping people is essential. Not only does it make the person being helped feel good, but it always makes me feel like I’m a better person.  As I proceed my career as  a doctor, I plan to continue to help thousands more.

Both Good and Bad Help Shape Where and What Your Meant to Be
No one lives a picture-perfect life and everyone has their own demons and story to tell. But I’ve always believed that no matter what your story is, how much trouble or pain it's ever caused you, that it should encourage you from moving on to bigger better things and pursuing happiness.
As some could say, I probably grew up more privileged than most as a young child. As part of the Mashantucket Tribal Nation our families were given great opportunities and taken care of very well and lavishly. My father had a very well-paying job, 3 cars, a beautiful home to house all his children, and a wife who never had to work in years and got to raise her children. Life was nice, more than nice actually. My siblings and I were granted the luxury of getting the finer, materialistic, things of our childhood. New toys and games every weekend, fun trips to Disney in the summer, ski resorts in the winter, I mean it was all anyone could ask for. But as the years went on and economy continued to fall so did the financial state of our tribe and ultimately the state of my family.
Incentives were soon taken away; pricey dinners were no longer a normal occurrence and then the big loss of all was my father's job…
Being mid junior high age, I was able to comprehend what was going on and happening to my family. Both my parents not really having a degree in anything, only one having a high school
diploma, they didn't have much else to fall back on after my father lost his job. We became dependent off what the state could assist with and I watched my parents cry and ulcer over how they were going to put food on the table this week or keep the lights on in the house, there'd be weeks where we lived with no hot water or heat because the price of oil was too expensive. And when people say things can change within a blink of an eye it really does.
As my older brother and I reached the legal age to obtain a job we put in 40+ hours a week in the summer and about 30 during school to help pay for bills my parents couldn't keep up with, to help feed our 3 other siblings and keep the house warm.
I could go on about how things weren't so easy anymore and how my early childhood to my teen and young adult years contrasted immensely, but my point is I've seen both sides of the fence, the rich green and the wilted yellow and it takes seeing and experiencing what you don't want or like to know what it is you do want in life.
I know what it is I need to do to put not only myself but my family in a better place and I believe this is where I was meant to be  and what has shaped me into the driven career hungry woman I am today.","

I believe that stagnation and repetition are major obstacles in the way of creativity and growth. Novel experiences broaden our knowledge of the world around us, allowing us to form a more mindful interpretation of it, and act as a muse for creativity and change in our own lives and decisions. 
Quite simply if you don’t know what else is out there how can you know that what you’re doing is what you want to be doing? Novel experiences from trying new sports or activities to immersing yourself in other countries geography or culture may cause you to question what you think you know.
One summer in high school my Grandmother brought my cousin, Allen, and I to Italy for 2 weeks. I had never been outside the country before so there were many novel experiences to be had. Watching everyone communicate across a language barrier was an enlightening experience, one which made me realize just how little we say in our words and how much we communicate through our expressions and posture.
On my way back I remembered what it felt like on the way in, how I had learned just from witnessing something different from my regular routine. Along with it came excitement from leaving my seemingly boring daily life to be immersed in so many new experiences. 
I try to do a reasonable number of new things all the time, to keep myself learning about things I do not know, to stimulate myself in ways different than the norm, and in the pursuit of finding the things in this world that I love the most. Now it should be said that balance must be kept in this process. If I was to only do new things all the time, I would never become a master of anything. New experiences widen your perspective, but it is important to remember what It was you learned.
Time to reflect on experience and decisions is almost as important as having the experience itself. Being mindful of how I felt and what I think about different things allows me to keep in tune with what will bring me the most joy.
I’m sure that no matter what I learn or how I grow I’ll always value new experiences; What can be learned from them, and just how fun they can be.

I believe that every experience I have, that is, the continuation of time that includes my experiences- every sensation, every thought, every emotion, every action, every word spoken, everything heard, touched, seen, tasted, and smelled, every interaction with others, no matter if it is viewed as negative or positive in the eyes of the beholder, can and is to be learned from. 
When I was 16 years old, I had one of the most amazing life changing experiences I have ever had. I was shown what mystics call “the light” where I was endowed with the information that has since shaped who I am today. This experience forced me to realize unequivocally that I can learn from every experience I ever have, not just subconsciously like I do without trying, but consciously understanding experience so as to pull information from experience and apply it to what I have previously learned about myself, the world, and others. Philosophers call it apperception.
Since this experience, I have become more mindful of myself and my emotional state, as it has helped me tune into my present moment experience with more precision and insight and less judgement. I have become much more perceptive to the outside world as well, as I am quick to analyze what I see and hear, but not without adding critical thinking to my own thoughts by questioning what I think and analyze to test to see if it adds up and can be added to my apperception. This eye-opening experience showed me that it isn’t enough to accept thoughts as truth. After all, thinking is a mental fabrication and therefore can’t ever get to the absolute bottom of a situation. If it’s our thoughts that create our reality, our reality will always be based on an elusive property.
If I am striving to learn and understand from my learning and experience and ultimately reach Truth, and to have each experience contribute to the overall building that my prior learning has built, my bias must be eliminated as much as possible. If I am to find Truth and acquire utmost knowledge and wisdom, I cannot be the one who determines this Truth. It has to be experienced as the Truth that it is or else, I may be biased and conclude my findings as Truth before I get there. In other words, my ego might get in the way of what I seek.
During times when I am using my full capacity to gain insight and knowledge through conscious learning of personal experience, my learning increases exponentially, as everything I learn is built on top of previous knowledge. This learning is the cohesive interworking of all modes of learning. Intellectualism has different characteristics than spiritualism, but just as DNA contains a myriad of different instructions all formed together by different molecules, it functions in parts, and as a whole. So too does learning and apperception. What I think translates into what I feel and vice versa, all throughout different modes of learning and experience. Rationalism, logicism, empiricism, etc… are all included in my understanding of the world/self and apperception. 
All of this I use to grow, evolve mentally, emotionally, and spiritually as an individual, and I see it’s effect on the world from my perception. Learning, growing, understanding, all happening at every minute when I try.

There was a time in the seventh grade where no matter how many times I read the definition to the word “faith” in the dictionary; I still did not know what it meant.  Of course, I knew what it was, but rather I did not understand what it was like to have it. I didn’t have faith in my family, friends, teachers, or myself.  Going to catholic school all of my life, religion and faith were constantly shoved down my throat between tests and classes and I sort of just accepted it as my own until August  15, 2010 when I realized that faith is not saying every prayer in The Bible, knowing the Beatitudes, memorizing the Ten Commandments, or getting a 100 on a test about the Apostles . This was the day my dad almost lost his life. Every week over the summer my dad and I would go fishing with my brother. We started by going to the same spot to dig up worms every time; this time was different, however.  My dad dug up an underground bee hive and was stung seventeen times. My brother and I did not know at the time, and neither did my dad, that he was highly allergic. My dad collapsed in our driveway and I was scared for my father’s life. My brother called 911 and I have never seen my older brother so nervous. Considering I always looked up to my brother as a brave and fearless person, to see him cry made me realize I knew it was serious. My mom was not even home and when the medical services came in with a defibrillator and rubbed it together to press onto my father’s chest, I found myself crying-hands folded, praying for someone to save him. We drove behind the ambulance to the hospital and when we got there, we waited for seven hours, thinking about all of the possible outcomes.  When the doctor came in to the waiting room of Vassar Hospital, saying that my dad was alive “by a miracle” I believed; I believed that God existed and that someone was out there protecting me and my family.   It was also in that moment that I realized faith does not mean believing  in supernatural things and history of The Church, it is about trusting that someone will be there to help or guide you in a time of need and suffering in the present. You may be wondering how this affects how I live my life day to day. Well, there are two reasons.  First, I now have a very strong faith in God and believe that everything happens for a reason, good or bad, there will always be a positive in some way, shape or form. If my dad had never been through that experience, I would have never found out that I too was highly allergic to bees.  Now that I had my faith, I trusted in a higher power to guide me through life through my struggles and high points.

Something that I choose to live by every day is a quote by Mohammed Ali: “Don’t count the days, make the days count.” You never know what will happen tomorrow, or even in the next hour or so.  It’s important to keep an open mind to whatever life will throw at you.  
When I was a junior in high school, I was an aspiring cross country runner.  I knew that I wanted to run in college and I practiced hard, even on the days I didn’t have practice.  I didn’t like running most of the time, but I did like to win, and I knew that I had to practice to win.  My main focus was when the next meet would be, and I wished the days would go by faster. 
During one of my invitational meets, I had a good start and was somewhere between fifth and seventh place by the end of the first mile.  This was the best place to be; usually these girls were right at my pace and I could get up to fourth if I sprinted at the end.  I decided instead to get a head start on the downhill.  However, they changed the course, and I didn’t know where I was going.  One part of my brain (the wiser part) was telling me not to go so fast when I didn’t know the course. The other 99% told me to go faster; so, I did.  
Long story short, I took a tumble.  My foot got caught in a tree root as I fell, and later on I would find that I had almost torn my ACL.  In the race, I remembered everyone asking me if I was okay, but all I cared about was getting back up and getting past the girls that had caught up as I fell. It hurt to run through, and eventually I made it to the finish line.  
Immediately after I fell to the ground (not so gracefully) and that would be the last time I ran in a meet.  My coach gave me ice and told me to see a doctor, but she didn’t have much sympathy since I didn’t get as high of a place as she wanted me to. I would spend the rest of that meet wishing that she would fall down a hill.
Afterwards, when I saw the doctors, they bent my leg and did lots of tests, as well as X-rays, and didn’t find anything wrong.  However, when they did an MRI, they found that I was less than a centimeter away from completely tearing my ACL.  A few minor procedures later (thankfully no surgery) I was in physical therapy.  I remember them telling me that I wouldn’t be able to run like I used to, and I remember feeling like my world was over. 
Eventually, I got bored out of my mind with all the extra energy that I had.  My mom had been kickboxing for a while, and she got me into it. This was helpful to keep away the anger and frustration from the injury. I realized that my whole life I hadn’t been enjoying each day, only living for the races.  Since that part of my life was over, I had to live for each day. This was definitely not a fun experience, but it taught me about the important things in life. ","100000011"

“The will to win, the desire to succeed, the urge to reach your full potential … these are the keys that will unlock the door to personal excellence,” are the words by Confucius that I have always followed since studying Confucianism during my freshman history class in high school. Since coming across this quote, I take every opportunity and challenge given to me, and I always aim to succeed by putting my best effort into it. I was always unsatisfied with my work unless I pushed myself to my fullest potential, and I never stopped working until it was done, even if it meant staying up until two in the morning. In part, because of my ambition and perseverance, I was able to achieve all my goals in high school, which eventually lead me to be here at the University of Rhode Island. Moreover, my high school career has definitely helped me gain personal excellence, as well as knowledge and realization of my own abilities. I believe that if you have the motivation to work to your fullest potential, you will get to the place you need to be no matter how difficult the circumstance is. 
My main goal in college is to complete all the requirements as a pre-medical student and graduate with a B.S in Biological Sciences. Like all students, I want to graduate with grades that I worked hard for and that I am proud of. Not only do I succeed academically for my own satisfaction, but I do it for my family as well. My family, specifically my parents, is my main sources of motivation. When my grandfather passed away, I had a sudden realization that I was actually transitioning from a child to an adult, and that it was now my turn to take care of the family. I promised to myself that everything I do in life is for my parents, and I will do everything in my power to achieve my goals to make them proud. Whether it’s winning a tennis match or getting an ‘A’ on an exam, my parents will always display gratitude and appreciate the amount of work that I put in that led me to my success. I am so fortunate to have an amazing support system from my family because without my parents, I would not have the motivation to achieve all these accomplishments. 
When I reach a difficult obstacle in my life, I never lose the will to win, the desire to succeed, or the urge to reach my fullest potential. My ambition and perseverance will always help me achieve my goals because no matter how difficult the task is or how late I stay up to finish it, the effort is worth it as the outcome proves its value. In addition, adjusting to college life has been difficult and sometimes I just want to procrastinate and push all my work aside. Whenever I feel like giving up on one of my goals, I always reflect on my past experiences to regain my motivation. Essentially, my parents’ reactions to my achievements motivate me to continue to be successful and even do better than I did before. On a daily basis, I make decisions that would make my parents proud because I know that in the end, I had the right motivation and work ethic to be deserving of the position I am in. Overall, I believe that if you have the motivation to work to your fullest potential, you will get to the place you need to be no matter how difficult the circumstance is.

My belief is that when you fail you need to keep trying in order to succeed.  From personal experience, I have found that if there is something that you really want to succeed at you can’t give up. This sounds cliché and obvious but I didn’t realize just how important that belief was to me until I came in contact with it. For my middle school and high school career, I was a dancer. I started dancing at age twelve which is rather uncommon, for most kids start dancing at age three. Ballet became my favorite type of dance and I faced a conflict because while everyone I knew had started learning ballet in preschool, I was just now learning in eighth grade. I was intimidated by the fact that I was so behind but the fact that in my first ballet class I was placed with kids who were all five years younger than me made it even worse. So I took ballet and I began to learn the basics while all of my friends were in advanced classes. I had every reason to not want to continue ballet but I decided to pursue it because it was what I really wanted to do. I worked really hard, I had my dad install a ballet barre in my basement and a large ceiling-to-floor mirror so I could practice. I took private lessons to perfect the things I was behind on and eventually, I was in the same level as all of my friends. Although, I had always loved ballet, being in class with my friends made it much more enjoyable and I knew I made the right decision to endure ballet classes. 
	I was so interested in ballet and so confident in my current skills that I made the decision to go to a competitive all ballet school to further my training. I went to the new school without knowing a single person and I did this all in order to succeed. Well, as soon as I got there my confidence shrank. Because this was a competitive ballet school, everyone there lived and breathed ballet. I was put into a class at the level I was on that first year I started ballet with the kids who were five years younger than me and I was so discouraged because I was right back where I had started. The class was getting almost unbearable because I knew I was better and I wasn’t getting the proper training. Again, I had every reason to not want to continue, but I did because it was really what I wanted to do. My fourth day of class, the owner of the studio came in to observe, she came up to me while the classical music was playing and I was doing my plies and releves and she asked me where I had studied and for how long. She said that I was too advanced for that class and wanted to move me up two levels. My new class was exactly what I had been used to and I thoroughly enjoyed going to class everyday again. I had many opportunities where I was faced with rejection and disappointment but I decided to keep trying because I knew it was something I really wanted to do and in the end I succeed. ","100000111"

My belief in myself started freshman year of high school. Before that, I was never a “good” student. I just was not too concerned with school in my younger days for various reasons. Nonetheless though, freshman year, I started to put effort in. This effort was an honest effort, academically, which was a entirely new world for me. I also pushed myself to join the wrestling team, this is also significant to me because I really never did or was into a sport. I found during freshman year that pushing myself just made me a better person. 
It was like a eureka moment, I swear. It felt like never-before-seen unknown gears in my brain started turning, and I found out that I love to learn and challenge my brain. Joining wrestling, got me in shape and pushed my mental game even further. I was doing things I would never expect myself such as; running 7-minute miles, flying through tests with 90s. It felt good to do well for myself, it was all because I applied myself. My belief is trying your hardest, why? Because you learn the most from experiences when you try.
I’ve experienced another eureka moment that shaped my “trying hardest I can” motto. The motto I am about to tell you is quite symbiotic with the first motto. Jump unto junior year, in April, I took a class trip to Greece. During the span of this trip was a special little day called, my 18th birthday. On that day, words barely give the experience justice. My tour group was on the top of the mountains in Delphi (the place where the oracles were).The tour guide brings up the topic of a philosopher named Epictetus and  some background information on him. Seamlessly transitioning from his background information to philosophy, she started going into a philosophical tangent  This tangent was truly worth hearing though. It basically said, how powerful the human mind was, and how humans can force better behavior by thinking positive thoughts. If something bad happens to you, your reaction is the matter. He says “pull back from the situation….compose yourself” because when something happens to you, the only power you have is your attitude towards it. When you wake up in the morning you determine if you’re going to have a good day selected on the behavior YOU chose. No one can impose an attitude you on yourself, but ultimately, you.
My attitude towards life was do my best, learn from my mistakes, and it will all be okay. I have to be honest with myself sometimes. Like in college, through the scientific method, I realized how to study after the first month. Reality checks are how you can stay honest, but keep positive to improve yourself. 
I learned in sociology this year, that the self is not a constant thing. The self is always transforming into a more current form. Through processes like critical thinking and social interaction with others. That’s what I plan to continue to do, grow.","100000112"

You’ve made it! No more six hours of school, no more forced structure, everything is up to you now, you’ve made it. This is an exciting time of your life but it can be destructive if not treated appropriately. Since you now get to manage your time you can, probably for the first time, decide your actions and the repercussions that come with them.
Time management is crucial in college and procrastination will get you nowhere. Time management is perhaps the most important trait to be successful and perhaps the most consistent trait among the top. Many of my friends had to learn this the hard way, they slacked by playing their favorite video games instead of respecting their classes and their grades. You can play video games, college encourages freedom, however moderation is a key step that many students with low grades disregard. Make sure you give yourself a long period of time for your homework or study, or perhaps finish your homework first then use the rest of your time to do as you please. Time management is very important to men and personally, my strategy is to get all of my work done before doing anything else. Once you get your work done you will just feel a sense of relief that you don’t have any assignments that are due and you haven’t done. This, in my opinion, is the best way to go about troubles with time management.There are also other key points regarding time management, such as avoiding missing class. Though not going to class is easier and your bed may be very comfortable a key element in having the grades you want is to make it to class. You’re the one paying for the education, make the most out of it. Also, not doing your work is going to be very detrimental to your success at college. Also, it is key to not you leave your work for last minute as you tend to rush and not do a great job on it. Instead, give your assignments all you got and the grades will speak for themselves.

There are a lot of things that have changed from high school into college. One being beliefs. Beliefs about who I can talk to, what I can wear, who I wanted to be?  But in this transition, you realize that none of it matters, you can talk to whoever you want, wear what you want to wear, but you can’t be whoever you want to be because that is something that comes from your core self.
Your core self can be very difficult to find, it could take a lifetime yourself. Luckily for me, I feel as though I found it last year during hard times where optimism was my savior. My beliefs changed on what you could achieve in the physical world as well as the spiritual world. I began meditating and working to build on having a positive outlook on life and not dwelling on the past and move towards my future. Though none of this would have been easy on my own, with the help of others who also wanted a positive change in their lifestyle, we would meditate as a group and help each other to remain focused on what we would want to achieve once school was over.
Even though I believe that core self-defines who you are, and that I found it that year, I believe that it is something you  have to keep working on because there is always something new to discover about yourself and the world around you. For example, I am confident in most things but what I struggle the most is what I want to do after college or if I should just drop out now and be famous for doing nothing like the Kardashians. Everybody has those aspiring dreams, that people the judge them for trying to go after or because they have to faith. But if I am determined enough in those big dreams, I can basically do whatever I want. It is only the effects of the people around me that makes me drift into places I would not rather be. I believe that my mind could change with the encouragement from the right person.
In order to overcome my obstacles, I will need to work hard to keep my grades good so that I have more options when I am older, I will need to meditate more, work out, and eat healthy, but also be lenient with what I want and know that I do not have to stick to anything. By doing these things, I believe my mind, body, and spirit will be in a healthy place to make all of my important decisions that I am to discourage to make now.","100000114"

How mindset affects success. In my 18 years of life, my mindset on how to attain success has been forever changing. But it was not until last year that my personal philosophy on success was solidified. Before I always believed that it was about how often you studied, or your innate talents, or even just how your day had been going, but there's something that triumphs all of those factors.
Going into college, I knew I had to adjust my mindset, but I had no idea how. High school taught me that there was an issue with my belief and how I went about my problems but I had not a clue what it was. Going into classes I tried to select general education classes that would help my GPA and make med-school acceptance more auspicious. And now, sitting here almost a month in, is where I realized that that was a mistake. My belief was challenged because I learned that it's not all about the challenge a course provides, but rather about my personal mindset towards the course. When I was planning for STEM courses to decimate my GPA, I missed a crucial point. I love science! Once I started reading the textbook, answering questions, and looking forward to my bio lecture, I realized that I wouldn't have trouble with the class because of how I enjoyed it. I go into every assignment with a positive mindset knowing I love what I learn, and I have been able to thrive. I have found happiness in answering the questions of other students and teaching them what I now know. And although I don't know how I did on my first exam, I do know that me loving biology will encourage me to study and do extremely well. Unfortunately, this discovery on my mindset affecting how I perform, didn't come until after I signed up for classes. This is reflected in my grades in my gen eds. The classes I'm taking I don't enjoy, and therefor I am not doing as well. I can try to change my mindset to the class and appreciate what I'm learning, but it doesn't change the fact that I realized I would do okay  in my STEM classes after I signed up expecting to hate them. My belief was changed because I realized that going in with a positive attitude and appreciation would only lead to success. My belief on how to be successful has always been challenged but I finally believe that I know how to succeed. If anybody goes in with a positive mindset that they like what they learn and they're there to learn it, then they will. It's always easier to know what you like, but sometimes people need to broaden their horizons. Always go in with a positive mindset and only the best will come of the situation.

	In conclusion it's clear how my belief changing to mindset affecting outcome has become grounded in my personal philosophy and affected my life. I can sign up for classes that I love and have a positive mindset about them, take regularly mundane topics and make them exciting, and go in to an unknown situation positive to make it positive. I look forward to living out the next 4 years and the rest of my life with the mindset being “if I'm positively minded, I will always obtain the most positive outcome”.

When I look in the mirror, I see a woman a beautiful, strong, independent, African American woman. I grew up in a society where being African wasn't accepted. The kids in my class picked on me, spit in my food, even hit me sometimes. They even called me an ""African booty scratcher"". Growing up, it was just my mom, sister, brother and I. We were homeless due to the fact my mom never paid for the mortgage when my dad gave her the money to do so and because of that my parents got divorced, I was 12. We didn't have any clothes, or food to take with us either. We slept in a car until my grandparents were nice enough to let us stay with them. We then found an apartment in a bad neighborhood. My mom couldn't afford a bed, so we slept on the floor until she got a full time job as a CNA. Even though my mom was a CNA, The bills became overwhelming for her to be paying alone so we got evicted and church became our new home. There was a guy who lived in the church with us as well, we all trusted him. Living in the church together, we became a family, he was like a father figure to us. Until the day he sexual abused me, my mom was livid and angry. He left church the same day and that was the last time we saw him. We moved out of church the next day and into my mom's new boyfriend's home, it didn't last long. He had a gambling problem and my mom didn't trust him at all. Again we moved into a place much affordable, but very dangerous. It was better than being homeless. When we moved our stuff in, the following week, someone broke into our apartment and took all of our things, as if we had anything to begin with. They stole our TV, our Nintendo 64 game station, money, and a DVD player. I remember my mom crying hysterically that day, it made us all cry. We've been through so much and I just kept asking God what we did to deserve this. A couple years later my mom met a guy who later on moved in with us and sexually and physically abused me multiple times. I kept it to myself because we already went through so much and she was pregnant with his child. I try not to think about the horrible things he put my siblings and me through, but it was quite difficult. That played a role on how I behaved in school academically. I was a freshman at Windsor High School. I remember teachers calling my mom and telling her that I wasn't myself in class, and that I wasn't doing as well as I was from the beginning of the school year. I went from having all A's to getting C's and D's. That man was the cause of my grades, but my mom didn't know that. She would ask me what was wrong but I always told her nothing was the matter. Now I am 22 years old, I'm currently enrolled in college I never imagined I would get into with a Biological and Medical Laboratory Science major. I am a CNA, have my own apartment and I'm currently taking care of my 18-year-old brother. I've been through so much, but I refuse to let my past phase me. I am determined to be the best student and doctor there is. I plan on becoming an Anesthesiologist or OB/GYN in the near future and I know whichever one I become, I will do great and I will be great.","100000116"

Once I heard a saying that really stuck with me and I think about it a lot. The saying goes “every day is a happy day just because you are alive”. It is such a simple statement yet so true. This quote has affected me in many ways. Throughout my life I have come back to that saying and it just reminds me of how lucky I am to be alive.
When I was in eighth grade, my Grandpa was in and out of the hospital regularly. So, when I heard from my mom that he had died, I was not surprised but I was still in such a state of shock. He was the first major death in the family for me and I was not helped through my grieving process and as a result my emotions were never really handled. So, the summer before ninth grade I developed depression. A lot of the time I would be too tired to leave my house and to upset and numb to do things that used to make me happy like dance and hanging out with my friends. Also, with the big shift of becoming a freshman in high school, I had to deal with the stress put on by social peers, the work load, and containing my own personal issues. As the months went on, my depression became more severe. By the summer before junior year, I was struggling emotionally like I never had before. It scared me a lot to see me get to such a low in my life. It was at that moment I decided to get help. Around that time as well I had found that quote. I had taken life for granted a lot and it made me realize that I have so much going for me, and I should be happy that I am alive and living the way I am. I went through therapy for about a year and I went on medication to help with my emotions. As I got better, I surrounded myself with new people and began to enjoy activities again like I used to. Junior year was still hard for me but by my senior year my grades had improved significantly and by the end of senior year I had straight A’s. Even after I graduated from my high school, I still held on to that saying about being happy. I can honestly say I hold this statement as a belief.
Even though I have been through a lot emotionally, I would not change a thing because where I was brought me to where I am today, which is a much more stronger and emotionally stable person. Sometimes it amazes me still that I am going to college and growing up and striving towards my goals for the future. I am excited to live each day and be more positive about life. Every day is a happy day for me just because I am alive.

My belief is to not judge others on appearances. Many people “judge a book by its cover”, but it is important in life not to do that. Growing up, during school and out of school, I was taught to not judge someone by the way they look. Someone may look a certain way but their personality is what really matters.
When I went on a mission trip with my church, we went to Lynn, Massachusetts. The town had a high poverty rate. The locals were very welcoming and had a positive attitude. When people see homeless people, they may walk away but many do not take the time to get to know their story. I volunteered at a soup kitchen during the trip, and had to sit with the guests and have conversations. I thought they would not want to converse much, but many wanted to share their stories. This is not something I would have normally done and I am glad for such a wonderful experience. 
Entering college has also taught me not to judge someone on appearances. Every day is a new opportunity to meet new people and that can only happen if you have an open mind. You never know who may end up becoming your closest friends. There may be many people who judge based on looks, and they are close minded because that is not what is really important. I have made friends with who I never thought I could approach. Taking the first step and introducing yourself is key to letting people know who you really are.

Immigrants have come into the U.S. for decades, seeking haven, opportunity or in some cases both. For my dad and his family, it was to seek safety, a place safe from all the violence in the previous country they left. He escaped along with my uncles and grandparents, all Armenians, avoiding certain death and torture by the Azerbaijani community. After my father’s arrival in 1991, he later married my mother, seven years later being the year, I was born. As I grew up in this environment of Armenian culture and ethnicity, I was also exposed to the American side, learning English in the process and getting used to the American way of living. I felt quite literally, a part of two worlds. With my Armenian culture came Armenian school which I had to attend for four hours every Saturday, for ten years. Being exposed to both sides, I felt somewhat different from my classmates and friends in my English school, having to go through an extra education on the side. However, I had some aspects of myself that made me as much of an American as anybody else. In American school, I learned English, talked English and was surrounded by all things American. While in school I ate pizza, gorged on hot dogs and consumed corn dogs with a gluttonous passion. I looked forward to Christmas every year and absolutely loved Halloween, the only time of the year when it was considered normal to dress up in a costume. I myself for one Halloween dressed up in a vampire costume with fake plastic fangs and an overly dramatic looking black cape.  While in school, I learned how to paint with my fingers, studied my multiplication tables, memorized all fifty states and their capitals and even learned of the United States’ development over the years during history class. With another day in Armenian School representing my awareness of distinction from others, I grew to understand what it meant to be part of the first generation, my parents having been born in other countries. I was raised in an environment not so typical of the average American. Instead of a cheeseburger or slice of pizza, I ate instead tolma, an Armenian cuisine which consisted of prepared vegetables or meat mixed with rice wrapped up in big grape leaves. Instead of waking up every Saturday morning to watch cartoons, I woke to only get prepare myself a lunch for Armenian school, which would last for approximately four hours. Instead of celebrating Christmas every December 25th, my family would celebrate Christmas on the 25th as well as on January 6th, the date that Armenians truly believe Jesus Christ was born on. Instead of rejoicing for the coming of warmer weather during April, my family and all other Armenians in the Armenian community would come together at the cemetery located near Benny’s down Providence and mourn together for all the Armenians that lost their lives during the Armenian Genocide of 1915 on April 24th. I grew to fathom how both aspects of my culture and identity, American and Armenian made up who I was as a person and how those aspects influenced my different perspectives and point of view as I grew up as person.

As a young girl, the one person that I have always looked up to was my great grandmother. She was a strong-willed individual who told the truth, spoke with pride about her family, and told stories of her childhood over and over again. She sang old nursery tunes at the top of her lungs, talked about the time she met my great grandfather, and laughed until she couldn’t breathe over and over again. Each and every time I listened like I’ve never heard the story and sang along like I didn’t hear it five minutes ago because the smile on her face made it feel like the first time. As a young girl, I wasn’t sure of what Alzheimer’s Disease was, but as I matured, I saw the ugly truth that hid behind my beautiful grandmother’s timeless grin. What I was sure of though was the immense love that I had for her and how she shaped my belief of how love should be patient.
Much of my childhood was spent volunteering at the nursing home where she lived. This gave me the chance to spend every Tuesday with her. Although my job was to complete activities with the residents and clean the pet room, I often escaped to the sanctuary that was my great grandmother's room on the third floor. There I would lie in her bed while she watched the news with the volume cranked to the highest setting. She would ask me what grade I was in, if I was getting good grades, what grade I was in, what instrument I played, and what grade I was in. As an oblivious young girl, I remember thinking that the reason she asked the same question so many times was because she was just making sure I wasn’t lying. But sitting here, seven months after she left, I now realize the devastating effects Alzheimer’s Disease can take on an individual and the ones they love. As I grew older, I stopped volunteering at the nursing home as often and began seeing my great grandmother less. This didn’t seem to matter to her though because every time I would see her, the lights in her eyes illuminated the room and she would burst into song. Seven months ago, the light in my life dimmed and I lost that song. The last memory I have of my great grandmother was holding her hand as I sang to her one last time.
Alzheimer’s disease has given me the lifelong belief that love should be patient just as I was with my great grandmother. Without saying it, she taught me to listen to what people have to say, even if it’s for the tenth time, love unconditionally because some people cannot help what they are going through, and to stop and appreciate life because there is so much potential in one person for it to be put to waste. Although she is no longer here physically, she is constantly guiding me through life and the advice she constantly gave plays in my head like the songs she used to sing. One piece of advice that will always go without her saying is to be patient with the ones you love.

Throughout life many things change. Likes, dislikes, the people we carry around us and the beliefs we follow, but one belief I have found I’ve never strayed from is the belief to be morally right. Having morality, to me, means being able to decipher the goodness and badness in the world and being able to follow the right path to become a good person. There are many issues and topics to talk about with morality, but one topic I have especially followed is the moral right that every human is equal. When I talk about equality, I don’t just mean equal rights based on gender or ethnicity. I believe that no matter what has happened throughout a person's lifetime or the state the person may be in, they deserve the same rights as me. For instance, in high school, a history class I took had a debate on the death penalty. To my surprise, I was one of the few people in my entire class to not believe in the death penalty. When asked why I took the side, I explained how I don’t think anyone deserves death, even the criminals who lie behind bars. They may have taken away another person’s rights, so they get their privilege rights taken away, but not their basic needs such as food, water, and the right to live. Not only that, but the thought process of the death penalty is a bit unclear to me. Why would a murderer receive the death penalty? What does that teach anyone? That’s like a little elementary school kid cutting some little girl’s hair, and then as a punishment he gets his hair cut. I am also pro-life. No matter what the circumstance, and I understand there are a wide variety circumstances, I do not think a person should have to suffer in place of another. My morals also cover the topic of equality of every person on the earth. I am a strong believer that every person in the world is equal no matter their status, ethnicity, gender, religious background, sexual orientation, and anything else. Being morally driven to me also means being able to do the right thing instead of the wrong thing. Doing things that would make me feel guilty, such as cheating, is something I wouldn’t feel right about. Overall I feel like being a morally driven is just being able to know the difference between the right and wrong thing, and just overall being a nice person.","100000120"

All my life I have been exposed to two different cultures, both of them leaving a lasting impression on my character. Being born in America while having parents who were born and raised in Nigeria, who are not afraid to claim their identity, has made me bicultural. I sometimes feel as though I have to reconcile with being Nigerian, and being American. At first, it was difficult to grasp the cultures, values, and beliefs of two very diverse countries. Although as I mature, I now understand how important both cultures are. I believe that my background makes me unique.
At home, my parents would speak both English and their Nigerian native language, Edo. Nigerian food, parties, and music were all a part of my life. I did not feel disconnected from that part of my background. As I was learning about the Nigerian culture, my parents also exposed
me to the values that they took pride in, such as independence and a good work ethic. I could not see myself as being any other nationality but Nigerian because it has been a part of me since I was born. With that being said, I know that I am very different from my family back in Nigeria. In Nigeria, race really is not as big of an issue. People do not think of themselves as black. Everyone shares the same skin color, culture, and mannerisms. I also relate to this concept in a similar way. Obviously, I cannot attest to the experience of living in Nigeria with people who
share the same culture, but I have experienced this with my African peers here in my community. There is an unspoken sense of camaraderie and acknowledgement. I feel as though it is easier to spark up conversations with them.
I find it funny that in America I am considered a Nigerian, but in Nigeria, I am perceived as an American. Because of this, I have always been questioning my identity. But as I grow
older, I realize that my different backgrounds are what make me who I am. My whole life, I have attended a predominantly white school. I found it hard to relate to anyone because no one fully understood me or my black culture in general. However, being in such a school has made me aware of my place in America. I realized that as a black woman, I am in the minority. I understand that I have to work twice as hard simply to get the recognition that I deserve. I have
come to terms with the fact that many of my white friends will not be racially profiled, nor will they ever have to fear for their life or doubt the protection that has been given to them. Being black in America is knowing that people who look like you are not always representing your interests in institutions of power.
When I look at myself, I think of a penny. On one side of the penny is my Nigerian culture, on the other side, my American culture. A penny is not complete without either side. Similarly, both of my cultures complete me. I believe that being African American has truly shaped me into who I am. My heritage has allowed me to appreciate the black peers in my community, and it has made me understand the struggle of being black in America in such a racially biased country. My African American culture has allowed me to gain a better sense of my background, and as I go forth, it will continue to shape me into who I want to be in this world.","

The first semester of  my freshman year in college can be described in four words; interesting, stressful, fun, and at some moments overwhelming. Everything in college is new, the professors, the work load, friends, and the living space. So far I have had a successful experience in college. I admit I wish I could have done better academically but I think I have preformed well for a new student in college. Since the majority of a person's life changes when they enter college there are a few things that I would suggest in order to make settling into college a little less stressful. One important thing is finding friends. Some people start making friends in the first few weeks while others begin to come out of their shell in the third month. It may seem difficult in the beginning but just remember that everybody is in a similar situation and they also want to make friends so one of the best ways to do this is to simply say hi or leave the dorm room's door open so hall mates can visit when they walk by. Another significant difference from high school and college are the classes and work load. I have noticed a pattern where there may be a decrease in the workload for a few weeks and then immediately there will be three exams and two essays due; there is no need to stress however. A challenge that many people have, including myself, is time management. Students find themselves with more free time than they did in high school so they may spend their time napping or socializing instead of studying. It is encouraged to get sleep and to socialize however as a new student you must learn to balance all of these things which can be difficult. My main tip to balance everything is to find the best time, for you, to study – some people prefer to study during the day and others like to study at night. I do my homework throughout the day in between my classes and earlier in the night so I can try to have a regular sleep schedule. Another way to be successful academically is to get help from tutors, peers, professors, or SI leaders. I struggled a lot in chemistry in high school so I knew I had to work really hard in college and the main thing that helped me to be successful was attending the SI sessions. He held two a week and for the majority of the semester I went to almost all of them. College classes are different because the class sizes are bigger and the material goes into more depth but if you reach out to get help that will go a long way. I think my first semester of college has gone well and I am excited for the next three years. Just remember that college can be fun and to explore any interests you may have.","

Throughout my life there were many things I would do that people would relate me to. As a child, I was always the one to be the first to do everything. I didn’t like the idea of being last or having to be told how fun something is. When I wanted to do something, I made sure I did it first and I made sure I did a good job at doing it. One thing that everyone knows about me is how sassy and matter of fact I am. You can tell me I’m wrong and I will fight until I can’t breathe to prove I am right. Never once will I back down from a fight especially if it means proving someone wrong. I am a rather strong headed person who doesn’t like to hear no or be told they are wrong. When it comes to going after things I want, I don’t stop until I grasp that idea or physical thing. My family and myself still have yet to decide if this is a good or bad thing.
With all that being said, there aren’t many firm things that I believe in. My mind constantly wanders since I am the type of person to get bored with something within the first 5 minutes of hearing it. I go from one idea to another within minutes if the original topic isn’t interesting enough to hold my attention. Never once can I stay thinking about one thing without coming up with something better. With that being said, there is something that I have always lived by and surprisingly have stayed living by for as long as I could make decision for myself. That said thing is believing that everything is within a person’s grasp as long as they try hard enough to get it. I believe that every person was put on this earth with a purpose and multiple ways to attain that goal or purpose. There is nothing that can stop that person from getting to that goal unless it is themselves. I like to live every day thinking that if I want it, I should go get it. There is nothing out there that cannot be achieved when you go after it and don’t stop until you get what you want. I take that saying and run with it daily, sometimes getting myself into some trouble in the process. I will come up with the craziest ideas ever, but if I want it bad enough I get it. Everyone in my family hates this because I always get what I want and I don’t stop at anything until I have that said thing. I’m the type of person that utilizes all sources to get the information that I need to achieve the goal I am chasing after. This is something I believe everyone else should do, if they want to achieve true happiness and self-satisfaction. I love being able to live my life knowing that I always tried my hardest for everything I wanted instead of wanting it and never making an attempt at getting it. This is something I feel that every person should be able to feel and live by.

Failure delivers an image that scares many of us.  People can experience hurt and may give up because of their frustrations, but there is a beautiful side to defeat.  It comes from taking that experience and turning it into something wonderful.  The reality of failure is not something anyone would like to experience.  Watching others go through disappointments in their lives is a struggle for me, but the reality is that it’s impossible to avoid.  Our lives are not perfect and that is just fine.  We can persevere and hold on to what we have to help us get through. My belief is that failure becomes a good thing in the long run. 
People commonly state, “Money does not buy happiness.”  What does that really say about a person?  Many who believe in this statement have not struggled with financial issues, but shall I call them lucky?  No I will not.  I am most happy when I have struggled to gain my earnings.  It is more meaningful.  I feel accomplished in the ending of it all. But money was not my issue; it was my parents’.  Without high school diplomas, they struggled with trying to maintain employment.  Having six children did not make it any easier.  It was hard for the eight of us and I felt like I was the failure.  It was not my downfall, but I had become apart of it all.  I expected an easy life, believing I didn’t have to worry about a thing.  However, struggles approached me without any consent.  I stumbled down a hole where I had no interest in being.  I later realized I didn’t need this situation defining and becoming me.  I didn’t want that identity for myself.  Watching both parents work their hardest to provide for us gave me the influence and strength to become great.
It was a terrifying decision for me to move from Louisiana to Rhode Island for my senior year of high school.  I left my education in Louisiana for better.  However, I left more than just my education behind.  I transitioned my old life for new.  I did not move to Rhode Island to end up a failure.  I’ve matured to become serious about my future and education.  It took me a lot to leave everyone I care about back in Louisiana.  Much of everything is very different, from the school system to my usual surroundings.  There is a substantial amount of change, which I’m getting used to and it’s quite overwhelming.  I believe I can do well here. Louisiana to Rhode Island is a huge challenge, but I have a strong head on my shoulders and I will be more than fine. 
The distressing encounters I have gone through gave me an experience I am thankful for.  I’m honestly happy this all happened to me at a young age.  It became something to learn from and to take all in.  The hard times and good moments have all shaped me into the person I will be proud of.  I began to admire the person I have become today, and for that I am more than happy

I believe in love. I believe in crossing oceans for people, even though they might not jump a puddle for you... and I believe everyone should be that way. I don't want to let the way this
cold world is harden me. I believe in turning the other cheek, and although some people may consider this weak, I think it is the strongest thing you can do, to have control over your emotions. Though I have received copious amounts of love from most people in my life, the most from my family, I have learned that not everyone will feel the same way. Some people will always dislike you, even hate you. But the true test of character is loving them back. I believe
when you don't know what to do or have lost your way, the answer will always be love. I live in a world filled with hate. Bombings, wars, people shooting blank men dead on the streets. It's an age old problem, when the answer is so simple. The Black Eyed Peas put it perfectly: where is the love?","

My belief is that if you put all your effort into something you can accomplish anything. Everyone in the world has the potential to change their lives, other people's lives and even the world. Imagine you are in a hospital with your family, waiting for your baby cousin to be born. The nurse traipses into the waiting room. The whole family stands up in anticipation. The nurse says, “It’s a girl.” The girls of the family smile with excitement while the boys are disappointed. The nurse then continues, saying, “But there is only a ten percent chance she will live past one week, and if she does survive, she will never walk.”
This moment changed not only my life, but my entire family's lives. Born on October 18th, 2005, Mia was diagnosed with Type Five Osteogenesis Imperfecta (OI). OI is a disease that causes brittle bones that break easily; furthermore, it stunts growth. Mia is one of 73 people in the world with Type Five OI in the world. It is the rarest class of the disease and one of the deadliest. Mia entered into the world with over 32 broken bones, including both of her femurs and five ribs. 
Mia not only survived, but she did the impossible.  After multiple surgeries and years of physical therapy, she can walk as if she never had a problem with her legs. She has broken a myriad amount of bones yet never ceases to have a good attitude toward life. Mia is the strongest and most determined person I have ever met. Anything she aspires to do is completed. Even after all she has been through the smile never leaves her face. On top of that her effrontery is astounding. Any hindrance put in her way will be overcome. Situations that older kids would shy away from doing Mia attacks with full force. Anything she is unable to do because of her disease, she makes up for with resourcefulness and ingenious solutions to the problem. In second grade during gym class the kids were playing tug of war. Mia unable to play, because of her disease, sat on the side. Distraught because she could not play along with her friends, she asked to play with a teacher on either side of her. This allowed her to play while the teachers kept her safe.
I am a 6”3 175-pound athlete and I look up to my three-foot-tall, 40 pound ten- year- old cousin. If there was one person I could aspire to be, it would be Mia. Other than my parents and sisters, Mia has changed my life the most. I have taken traits that she has and tried to implement them in my own life. Her tenacity, bravery, and vigilance are things to be admired. Mia has taught me to not only to believe in myself but to put all my effort into everything. At times I still fail to accomplish this, but then I look at Mia and try even harder the next time.
Mia has made me believe that not only can I accomplish anything that I put my mind to but anyone in the entire world can accomplish anything they put their mind to. She has shown me that if you try your hardest to accomplish anything that you will eventually succeed.

I like old things better than new things. I Firmly believe in “buy quality not quantity, make things to last, function should dictate design” I always am able to admire an object for its craftsmanship. I appreciate the finer things in life. I like the idea of someone putting effort into making something to the best of their ability and something they are proud of. I feel this way because everything that I do or make I try to do it with one hundred percent of my ability. I like to think that I can always tell if someone has rushed or took the easy way out when completing a job. I think I learned the importance of craftsmanship and caring about the product you produce two summers ago. 
I took a job with an irrigation company as a full-time job during the school year, I was introduced to the work force at a young age. I quickly understood how to conduct myself throughout my day as a professional. I learned that hard work produces a stellar product. I was surrounded by men. Men who were about as manly as one could be. They appreciated robust machines. It is common knowledge that “they don't make things like they used to”. I can remember the first time I heard this statement, It made me think ”why”? Why would we make things cheaper? Why would we make a flimsier car, why would we use lower quality parts? All of this makes a product degrade and fail quicker. It seemed so counterintuitive, whatever you make should last a long hard life of service.
I like old things better than new things for this reason. Fifty years ago, companies and manufactures had the mindset of build it for life, now we produce throwaways. Call it culture or a new fad but this is reckless behavior. I love all of the old hand tools from the forties, they are so simplistic and still work today if you pick them up. Im sure that they would work better than a new plastic version and cause less harm to the environment. When you have to remanufacture the same product because it was deemed as disposable is causes a huge carbon foot print. Paper eatery for example, why would we continually decimate the Forrest to produce plates and cups? It’s because we are too lazy as a society to wash a glass one. The glass plate can last a life time and think about how many trees you save. Now here’s the catch, A plate make today has poor glass quality and it is most likely thinner, however a plate made in the thirties would be twice as heavy and be almost green like the old Coca-Cola bottles. The green hue means pure strong glass. Old things have character and show the use of the product on its surface. When something like a tool has character the owner tend to take care of it more and be less inclined to buy another. 
So, buy quality, buy like it was made  fifty years ago by caring hands, use the product to its full potential. Admire the older things in life because they have more soul.

I am a firm believer of love. I feel the state of our world is due to the deprivation of love. People kill one another, steal from each other, and destroy. Human beings are selfish and evil creatures when they are not loved. I went to a catholic private high school and the experience is one I greatly appreciate it as I came to grow in my faith but there are parts of it I disagree with. I felt that as my life went on I knew the answer to everything when obviously that statement is false. Ever since I’ve realized that I have noticed that those who believe they know everything truly don’t learn anything. There is something in their brain that keeps them from learning. I also believe learning is fundamental to a happy life. Learning is a beautiful concept as a human being should never be trapped in a constant mindset. Learning enforces change and change is bliss. Change causes humans to live. Life in the comfort zone is not a life worth living. Humans are meant to attack each day with the confidence of a lion. Life is so beautiful and I believe in many things like a beach, music, good book, or the company of others are the antidotes to many problems but love is the real cure. Love for yourself, this world, and others will make this experience one worth living regardless of the good or bad. I appreciate the difference of each person whether a person has down syndrome, is homosexual, or simply has different color skin I think everyone needs to be loved. With that love we must love our brother and sister’s differences. Obviously my belief is easier said than done because humans, including myself, will do otherwise but life is all about trying. Once you give love you will receive love. If there is a sense of love for oneself, that person will respect his or her body and their body will function better, if one loves his or her fellow kind they too will experience the euphoria of being involved and invested to others. The love I speak about is not conditional. This love is ever bracing and universal. Whether it be romantic, paternal, etc. the intimacy of it is unlike any other feeling in existence. Finding a soulmate, your best friend, having your family is possible through the investment of love. Essentially all religions have a common theme to love. If Jesus and Muhammad preach to love, then it’s a good indicator that this should be a theme to live by. I am grateful for those around me that demonstrate such a passionate love for me because those are the people that want to see me succeed and will care for me in good and bad times. I am forever in debt to my parents for raising me in such a loving environment and supporting my dream to go to college and my pursuit to become a doctor. I am in debt to my significant other as she is my right hand and the angel on my shoulder. I am in debt to my friends for such memorable times and new memoires to come. I live my life acknowledging the debt I owe to this world and hope I have an extraordinary life that pays that debt off by making the world a better place. I know deep down I am meant to set this world on fire.

Judging a book by its cover is quite possibly one of the worst things you can do when you first meet someone. I firmly believe that you should seek out the best qualities, the hidden qualities about a person that makes them unique. Being able to pick out the obscure qualities that make a person who they are is something I pride myself on, as well as something people admire about me. To this day it is such a huge pet peeve of mine to see someone make a blatantly objectified statement about a topic or person they know nothing about.  I blame this on ignorance, if people wanted to broaden their minds they would put in the effort to do so. Those who choose not to are simply closing themselves off to potential life experience, and more importantly, friends. 
I remember in my sophomore year of High school I met a guy named Dylan. We had gym together; he would always run with me, trying to start up a conversation. However, our conversations would eventually fall into an awkward silence like new people do when they run out of things to talk about. From the scarce conversations we did have in class, I could see that Dylan was a cool guy just trying to make friends, and I appreciated his effort so I reciprocated. We were acquaintances at first and would say hi to each other in the hall, and ask how each other’s weekends went. Mainly small talk, but after getting to know each other better we became friends. We liked the same music, the same hobbies, we even had the same sense of humor; which is rare because I find dark, twisted, gut wrenching humor hilarious. We had gotten pretty close over that year; he even came out of the closet to me which was arguably the most noble and courageous things I’ve seen someone do to date. Dylan was obviously more feminine than other guys. People would make fun of me for hanging out with him and call him offensive things behind his back to me, but I didn’t care. He was my friend, and he was a damn good one. That’s the only thing that mattered to me. 
We remained friends through the high school but it was only at the end of senior year did I see Dylan for who he really was. We were walking to the parking lot at the end of the day to go home, discussing the newest episode of South Park, and we noticed pink paint on Dylan’s car from a distance. Someone had written “Faggot” down the length of his car. I looked at him and I didn’t know what to say. There was nothing I could say. He spoke first and said, “The guy who did this had to buy pink glitter paint, but I’m still the faggot? That’s rich.” We looked at each other burst out laughing and I helped him wash his car afterwards. I’m proud to say Dylan and I are still great friends to this day. He has the most amazing ability to defuse even the tensest situation with comedy. It’s something so few people know about him, but one of many qualities in my friend I cherish the most. My advice to those people is that you may surprise yourself at what you find if you read more than just a person’s prologue. So keep reading.

An event that helped shape my core values was my journey to Eagle Scout.  My journey to Eagle Scout was a long a difficult journey that taught me many lessons, but the biggest one was to never give up on myself. This is a belief that I now carry with me where ever I go. My journey started when I was the only one of my friends to move onto Boy Scouts. This was a difficult transition period for me because I was also changing troop, from Pack 30 to Troop 85. I had had to adjust from working with people I know, in my friends, to working with people who I had never met. This period of Boy Scouts was the first time that my belief of not giving up on myself was tested.  With my father’s encouragement and me not giving up on myself I persevered through this challenge and continued Boy Scouts. After this first test of my belief there were many more.  As I progressed through the ranks of Boy Scouts my journey became exponentially more difficult. I had to earn different leadership positions. These leadership positions varied from as simple as patrol leader to as difficult Senior Patrol Leader. As Senior Patrol Leader I was in charge of running the meetings for the troop.  This position truly tested my belief because if I gave up on myself, not only would I have not reached the rank of Eagle Scout I would have been failing all of the kids in my troop.  This extra pressure of having to be there for my troop truly solidify my belief and gave me the courage to achieve the highest rank in Boy Scouts. The final leg of my journey was to achieve the rank of Eagle Scout. This would be the hardest part of my journey and test everything I learned in Boy Scouts and test my belief in not giving up on myself. The first part to achieving Eagle Scout was to come up with a project and once I had a project get it approved by council. After considering many ideas, I finally landed on building a bridge over a small creek at a local park. Coming up with my idea was easy compared to filling out the necessary paper work and getting my idea approved by council. Filling out the work really tested my ability not to give up on myself because I needed specific details on how my project would be complete, what materials I need, and how I would secure those materials. Eventually I completed my paper work and got it approved by council. Next, I had to coordinate people to help build my bridge.  All of the people who helped me were people from my troop that came down on a pair of weekends to help me with my project. A lot of the people who came down to help were adults and all had their own idea of how the bridge should be built, but I had to believe in myself and the bridge got built according to my plans. My journey through Boy Scout taught me many things, but it instilled one many beliefs in me and it was to never give up on myself.","100000131"

Over the past year, I completely changed my life around.  When I came to a point where I lost all motivation and isolated myself from the world, I had an epiphany and decide to change.  Through struggle and wanting to give up, I pushed myself to realize that when it comes to your own life, you get out what you put in.  Simply, I learned to love the world.
A year ago I was on academic probation at URI as a double major in sociology and psychology, I smoked a fair amount of cigarettes, and I lived in my own self-pity.  I blamed my laziness and bad grades on my given situations, and it even took me a while to accept the fact that I wasn’t utilizing all my opportunities!  Life had been handing me opportunity after opportunity, and I was watching it pass me.  After hitting rock bottom, leaving URI, and taking classes at a community college back home, I realized that if I continue this lifestyle I would immensely regret it when I’m older.
It was difficult filling out the paper work and making the calls to re-enroll back into URI.  It became a mental block and I let my stress take over.  I couldn’t handle the raw facts.  When things weren’t moving along, I realized that I am the leader of my own life and I had to get my sh** together.  Finally, I submitted my forms and got accepted back in.  It was time to get real.
I learned to take in knowledge from my sources!  Everyday I taught myself something new.  I actually spent time getting to know myself after 20 years.  I realized then that I hated my major.  I was planning on going into criminal justice because I have always wanted to be in the FBI.  I was greatly influenced by my neighbor, who I did not even communicate with.  He had been diagnosed with a high form of Alzheimer’s in 2015.  Hearing about all the worsening medical problems propelled me to make a difference.  That was when I decided that I wanted to work in the medical field.  So I switched into Biology to follow the career path of a Physician’s Assistant.
Once I came to my senses and found my passions, I finally gained back the motivation I hadn’t felt in the longest time.  I had a goal and I finally knew what I wanted, so I got myself through the community college courses and brought up my GPA.  When I sent in my records for my grades, URI gave me back my financial aid scholarships!  Find that out was so relieving; I had finally taken control of my life.  I put myself back together.  Now, I do not smoke cigarettes, I live a much healthier lifestyle, and I have opened my mind to accepting life and what it throws at me.  Today I am confident and have faith in myself.  I’m grabbing life by the horns, and I’m not letting opportunities pass me anymore.  I preach it now; I’m a life enthusiast.  I love life and everyday I catch myself thinking, “Wow, the world is SO cool.”  It’s an awesome feeling to feel like a person with a purpose again.

I believe in hard work because it teaches us that anything is possible with enough determination and desire. Hard work and success are often linked and though there is no secret to success, most successful individuals will tell you hard work is the key ingredient. This is evident in all different professions, from Michael Jordan to Albert Einstein these people put sickening amounts of hard work into their crafts spending countless hours working because they believed they could benefit one day. As a matter of fact, I see myself as an example of hard work paying off which is portrayed through my high school football career. As a freshman I was easily the smallest player on my high school football team, I weighed just over a hundred pounds soaking wet. This established to my coaches I would not be of use to them as they figured football was a measure of physical measurables. This inspired me to prove them wrong, and so as I rode the bench for my first three years of high school I worked as hard as I could to be the best football player I could. Still a small framed athlete my hard work is what motivated my coach to give me a chance to prove to him what I could do on the field. Getting my first career start as a senior was exciting as I felt this was my moment to negate my doubters’ beliefs and it was a long time coming. From the performance in my first game I finally had my coaches as supporters and for the remainder of the season I played the best football I had ever played and proved that football is not a game of physical measurables but rather the drive we each have inside. I believed in hard work so much that I was okay with not being the biggest, the strongest, or the fastest as long as I was the hardest worker in the game. I started as the smallest and arguably worst football player on the team to an all-state selection with dozens of football awards, this is a first-hand testament to the power of hard work and the reason I am a firm believer of it. I believe the concept in believing in hard work is crucial too, it makes allows us to have faith that hard work will eventually pay off. This is also evident in my everyday life when I look to my mom; my mother is a single parent and works two jobs to keep her three sons from worrying about food or shelter. I believe in hard work and so I believe things will turn out for the better, not to say this doesn’t drive me to change her life-style before relying on my belief in hard work. Hard work’s benefits exist around us all every minute of every day and if each person began to work diligently they too can reap its benefits.   ","

My name is xxxxx, and I believe in the power of change. Specifically, I believe in the importance for the belief that some things can be changed. When I discovered that I could change the way things were and that those things actually had the ability to change (specifically how people live), I realized that I had been lied to. An important factor for me in accepting this belief was figuring out who was lying to me. I present to you: Mother Culture.
Mother Culture is an entity written about in the book Ishmael by Daniel Quinn. This book introduces many ideas pertaining to our culture and the culture we oppress (the tribal culture). The concepts presented in the book blew my mind as well as the minds of my classmates, and I found myself thinking about them nonstop. One main idea that has stuck with me the most is that of Mother Culture. Mother Culture is like a judge working for the way we live. She is all around us, constantly inserting her opinions in situations, telling us what is right and wrong, but she is also fake and not to be trusted. Seeing as she surrounds us, once you see her and recognize her voice, you cannot ignore her. In the book, Quinn states that once you are aware of her presence, you will not be able to comfortably fit back into your society, because you realize the lies that riddle it, which are perpetuated by Mother Culture.
Mother Culture is insecure and needs people to listen to her in order for her to survive. She wants things to stay as they are, with billions of people blindly following her and her jurisdictions. She doesn’t want anyone to mix anything up or take her power away. This is the voice that tells us that change is not possible.
In this way, Mother Culture is the biggest competitor against progressives who are unhappy with the way the people of their culture live, but she hides behind a mask, making her difficult to identify. Instead, she likes to make people think that the way our culture lives (she would call it the “civilized” culture) is the right – and the only – way to live. She makes it seem impossible to improve our culture to work better for the people in it.
Mother Culture has her system down pat. She uses people as her puppets and assures them that humans are the most important beings in the world. She assures the people of her culture that this is the way people have to live. The discomfort, sadness, depression, and suicide they experience is just a part of living, not a part of the way we live. It’s just a product of being human. Then the progressives come along, expressing their discomfort, sadness, depression, and suicide, and their frustration with why so many people feel this way. Mother Culture, speaking through her followers, sees the threat and says no, your discomfort is just a part of living. You don’t know real hardship or responsibility and think you can be lazy and evade both. The progressives get frustrated, because they feel like they are in a prison, but they don’t know the bars to fight against. This is why so many revolutions of our culture have fizzled out. The people behind them know what they are feeling and know that it doesn’t have to be that way, but they can’t find the bars holding them in.
Yes, I am still struggling to find which bars to fight against, but at least I know the entity holding them up. I am comforted greatly by the facts that I have the power to enact change, problems have the ability to be changed, and that once the prison bars of our culture break, the people will come flooding out.","100000134"

I value genuineness. I believe wholesome, well-rounded, kind hearted friends and family. I have grown up for the past 18 years with a dad who was very judgmental of everything I did. I figured out when I was about 9 how to change my lifestyle to conform to his expectations. Still to this day I try to please my father, and I can’t figure out why. I feel as if he has never truly been proud of the choices I have made in my life, and this is a story of a time when I will never forget his shamefulness. 
When I was a sophomore in high school, I was asked to the homecoming dance by a boy who I had had a crush on for a while. We started dating shortly after the dance. At the time, my parents had been divorced for about 5 years and I never really talked to my dad about my love life, that was obviously information for my mom’s ears. However, while sitting at dinner with my dad, his girlfriend, and her children, the topic of the homecoming dance comes up from the past weekend. So of course after hearing my dad’s girlfriend’s children tell stories about their night, my dad asks me “So how was your night liv? Can I see pictures?” At this point I was a little worried because I had not mentioned to my dad that I had a date to the dance, nor that I was dating this boy. I pull out my phone and try to quickly scroll through pictures so that he would not be able to see the ones of me and my boyfriend. But of course he pulls the phone out of my hand claiming he “can’t see” and automatically swipes to the picture of me and my date. He stares at it for a while and then asks “Was this your date?” and my heart immediately drops into my stomach. My step siblings start chuckling around me saying “Oooooo Liv has a boyfriend!!!” and my face is quickly turning red. To be honest, I don’t remember much of the conversation after that because I was so anxious, trying to mumble out sentences that didn’t make any sense. Then he said it. Something I will never forget. “Liv are you really dating him? You could seriously do so much better...why him??”    
I am still dating the same boy to this day and I regret absolutely nothing. He is hands down the best person in my life and I cannot see myself being the person I am today without him. My boyfriend has struggled with obesity since he was a child, and it hasn’t changed one thing about him. He is the most positive, uplifting person. I can turn to him with any problem I have and know that he will be there to help me, guide me, and most importantly, not judge me. 
Unfortunately, I cannot say the same about my father. What I have learned from this story, and stories just like this, is that I can only believe in myself and trust that I am doing the right thing for ME. I am living my life to my expectations and trying not to compare myself to other people’s standards. I want to be my own individual.

“Be who you are and say what you feel, because those who mind don’t matter and those who matter don’t mind”. Ever since I was a little girl it was challenging for me to fit in and be myself. There were always rules and guidelines on how to look, how to act and how to get people to like you and of course they would always change. I believe that over the course of the past four years of school I came to the hard realization that your inner self is far more meaningful than anything else and that you have to accept yourself before anybody else can. Out of nowhere, I was a little fish in a big pond; middle school had faded and high school had commenced. At this stage in our lives, I think it’s fair to say that no one really knows who they are or what they want to provide to this world. I saw myself on a superficial level like every other teenage girl around me. Acne camouflaged my entire face and loser was plastered on my forehead. With that, I ate an astronomical amount and dubbed myself Tubby Tori. I used clothes, makeup and the latest hairstyles to conceal my insecurities and I envied the girls who were classified as the “popular’s” who were pretty and perfect. As cliché as it all sounds, experiencing not fitting in and not looking the part is so much more brutal than the way movies glamorize the come-back nerd. I was lost in my befuddled sense of values and considered more about my physical attributes than my own mental characteristics. It was soon that I would conclude that people view you the way you view yourself. School never specifically taught me how to treat myself and it took me a long time to finally become satisfied with the person I really was. It is a concept that is so much easier said than done—to be content and self-assured in the person you are and no one can teach you how to do it. I came to the realization that what was on the inside is what counted more than anything. I am out of this world funny, creative, independent, outgoing and sympathetic. I am also stubborn, sometimes hypocritical, very gullible, and don’t know what the word common sense means for the life of me. But that’s who I am, and people love me for these reasons; my inner heart. That’s exactly why it is crucial to be who you are, it shapes your future and leads you to eventually loving yourself. Ultimately it took me a generous amount of time to be confident in the person I was in place of the way I looked. I constantly remind myself that my personality is so much more memorable and invaluable than an outfit. Although I have come a long way, I am still in the midst of the process even as a freshman in college. I always try to remember that people will always be prettier than you, people will always be smarter than you and people will always be younger than you, but they will never be you.

In my life there have been many key moments that have shaped my core values and belief. I believe that everything happens for a reason and the events you experience are really what impact who you are in the greatest ways. From these events I have Learned to always work hard be kind to others and from recent experiences I have learned to never give up and the most important thing in life is family. All of these are basic examples of the person I am, I believe that I am a hard-working and respectful person who appreciates life and all of the things it has to offer. I believe that all of these values were instilled in me directly from the way I was raised by my parents and the struggles they have endured to get me the things I want in life and they ultimately provided me with great opportunity. Also being able to witness on an everyday basis the hard work my parents have done their entire lives it made me come to the realization that you must work hard to achieve great things in life and I truly believe being surrounded by them has helped shape me into the person I am today. Another core belief that I have obtained through my life is to always be kind to others because you don’t know their story. Many people come from different backgrounds and have entirely different lives and simple expressions of kindness and compassion can go a really long way. I believe this one of the most important aspects in life due to the positive results it may have on someone’s life. I also believe new beliefs have been derived from recent experiences in my life. On July 7th, 2016, my mother was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma and I knew that my family would have to go through a lot to endure this terrible time. I believe moments like this happen for a reason, it may be unknown why, but it happened for one. I believe this is just a test for my family to stay together and get through it as a whole. I have learned many things from my mother in my life and this was a very devastating time for me. Seeing her doing well and fighting has proven that she is not a quitter and neither am I. I believe that this occurrence has shaped me and improved my attitude and ability to deal with challenging times in life and when times get tough I will still be standing and in the fight. All of these events and experiences have shaped me to be who I am today and I am thankful for being family oriented, hardworking and tough. I believe at the end of the day you will see a smile on my face no matter what is happening in my life. I believe I will be kind to others and promise to always work my hardest and stay true to myself.

Growing up I have had a lot of role models in my life. These role models have taught me the ways of life and brought me up to be who I am today and have instilled my beliefs in me. The people who have had the most influence on my life are my parents and coaches. I have cheered for ten years and it seems like I’ve spent more time in my life with my coaches and teammates than I have with my family. Even though I have spent a lot of my life focused on cheer I have also learned a lot from my parents who have always supported me and given me the best that they could. 
The things that I have learned from my role models is what drive me to be the person I am today and do the right things in life. My parents have always taught me to be a kind, caring and polite person no matter who I am around and this has helped me to be a poised person in any situation even when things get tough. My mom and dad provided me with as many opportunities in life that they could and among these opportunities was the chance to travel to El Salvador twice for service trips. Since I have been so lucky in my life it has taught me to give back to others as much as I can. This is why I enjoyed doing these trips and helping out my community in other ways. Many people that I grew up around believed that I lived a privileged life and while I do know that I was lucky to have these opportunities they were never taken for granted. This brings me to the fact that I am also a humble person because of my parents because they gave me these opportunities but also taught me that because I have the privilege to do certain things doesn’t mean that I was ever above anyone. I personally never believe that I am above anyone and it is a pet peeve of mine when people say that I’m better than others or that I am too spoiled because I don’t believe that I act in any of those manners. 
Besides the infinite number of qualities that I have received from my parents I have also learned a lot from my coaches and the ten years I have spent cheering. Cheering is a major part of my life and it has given me many outlooks on life that I might not have seen if I never joined my cheer program. I have learned to always finish what I started, to always believe in what I’m doing and to always be dedicated and committed to whatever task I am doing. I have learned all of these traits from my head coach who is someone that I am very close with and love like my own family. She never saw the sport as just an income for her life because we were her family and she always put our needs over her own. Our gym motto was “believe” and this is something that I always like to remember when times get rough or something doesn’t go the way that I planned because there is always an end to the means and you just have to believe in it. I wouldn’t be the person I am today if it wasn’t for the role models I have had in my life and all the opportunities I have been privileged to have and all it has taught me. ","100000138"

I believe in the benefits of having a canine companion. I’ve always loved dogs. I’ve almost always had a dog in my life. And when I didn’t, I wanted one. The benefits of bonding with a canine companion are endless. Dogs reduce anxiety and depression, lower blood pressure, and help keep their owners physically active. They can be trained to sniff out tumors, warn of seizures or low blood sugar. Dogs risk their lives protecting their owners whether they are police officers, soldiers, or family members. They provide valuable support to those who are disabled. But most importantly of all, they are our best friends. Which brings me to the story of my puppy Milo.
Milo is a pure breed Saint Bernard pup and his resemblance to the actions and personality of Beethoven is almost scary, however he is no Cujo. Milo came into my life on February 21st, 2016, when my mom urged my father to take me out for more highway driving practice. That day was a Sunday, and my last day on winter break from school, so my dad wanted to make this outing more adventurous than spending a couple hours driving for no real purpose. Thus he suggested visiting a place called the Perfect Puppy in Scituate, RI. When we arrived on location, my dad and I were somewhat disappointed. There were only small, yippy little dogs at the store and my family had allows loved and preferred bigger dogs. My dad started talking with an employee and said that they had a second location in West Warwick where they had some German Shepards, Siberian Huskies, Labradoodles, Rottweilers, and Saint Bernards. When the employee said Saint Bernards my desire to go to their other location went soaring through the roof and I insisted to my father that we most go there at once. 
Once we arrived to the Perfect Puppy’s second location, I practically bolted from the car and was drawn straight to a Saint Bernard pup in his pen. You can say I fell in love at first sight. I stood guard in front of that pen for at least an hour, not letting anyone else come near. As soon as a saw that dog, without a shadow of a doubt I knew it was going to be mine. If anyone even attempted to come near I would give them the most evil stink eye in the world (I think people might have thought I was a bit crazy). After my father had finished seeing all the other puppies, I delivered a sales pitch that could not be matched by a professional marketer. The moral issue my father was facing was that we already had a dog at home, who was approaching on fourteen years of age. The battle lasted a while and I could see cracks in my father’s resolve. He finally said “Ask your mother,” which was futile in his defense against getting a dog. So I texted my mom a picture of that adorable Saint Bernard pup and informed her that if she said yes, my father would get the dog.
My mom thought we were pulling a joke on her. She called my dad and told him: “Yes. I dare you.” This if anything sealed the deal in my dad’s decision to get the puppy. So, my father and I, both sat down, filled out the paper work and brought home a new addition to the family. Although at first my dad was a bit nervous and suspicious about bringing home Milo that first day, you can ask him now that he also never had a doubt about bringing home that adorable pup. He also has no regrets either. He has said on multiple occasions that he has never down right said that he has loved a dog before, even after having many in his life previously. Milo has brought so much joy, happiness, love and laughter into our lives that life without him is unimaginable. I believe in the benefits of having a canine companion after witnessing the positive impact a dog has on a person’s life.

I started this essay an hour ago, with the topic of believing in love. After some time, I resulted in scripted lines of what the emotion does to the body and some experiences from my past which made me think the way I knew I should. But I couldn’t seem to spill out to the right words of what truly made me believe being in love was undeniably real. So the next thing that comes to mind, after love (for me) is heartbreak. After this love that can form into a relationship, you either continue together for the rest of your lives, or break up-a scary thought. So I believe in heartbreak, which I can explain better in 500 words than I could love. 
For me, heartbreak was the most significant destruction of feelings. When thinking about it, it still strikes a nerve, even years later. How could the same person who expressed their love to me every day not want me anymore? The space between my fingers no longer held my lovers hand, but filled with pregnant air instead. Weeks after the break up, I still felt I was getting nowhere with this recovery. I’d lay, curled up in a ball in my room, crying to Elvis’ “Can’t Help Falling in Love”, wondering why it seemed so simple in the song to stay in love. Of course there were legitimate reasons to break up, but not seeing him anymore, stopping abruptly? The one person continuously on my mind for years on end? Unreasonable-I couldn’t do it. The fibers of something inside me were pulling apart, causing the most excruciating wound. I recall the time I squished my fingers between closing garage door panels, and the time I fell off my bike, scraping my face up enough to look like a character from Halloween-no physical pain had amounted to this emotional pain I was going through. Curling up in a ball seemed to ease the pain, making me feel whole again. Ever since the breakup, a somber wave had come over me, you would no longer catch me laughing or joking. I knew I had to stay alive to please my parents, but I was so weak, I barely was living as it was. Everything seemed to relate back to him, whether it was driving to a store or climbing a mountain. I no longer worked out because I was so feeble, I wouldn’t have been able to carry more than 10 pounds on my back before I felt dizzy. There was nothing to take my mind off it-no family game night or going for a drink with friends could aid the gaping hole. This was, in the most literal form, heartbreak. I believe in it because I felt it, and I know I felt it deeper than most. 
Most importantly, I believe heartbreak is temporary. I’ll never forget what feelings festered in me after that experience, but I know I survived it. So I am proud to spill my weaknesses out on this paper, and counteract them with the idea that I am still here, living an incredibly carefree and joyous life. Maybe I’m still recovering from it three years later, but I think I’m just putting myself together even more, finding out more about myself. “Maybe instead of trying to find my other half, I should take time to piece myself together.”- Anonymous  ","100000014"

Family: Noun, a group consisting of parents and children living together in a household. Sometimes the dictionary gets a definition wrong, or doesn’t explain it quite right. Sometimes the definition doesn’t pertain to everyone. Like me, my definition of family does not include “consisting of parents and children”. My definition of family is anyone who is always there for you and has improved you to be a better person. They are a shoulder to lean on and they’re your biggest cheerleader. When I was little I used to think the perfect definition of a family was a mom and dad happily living in a house with a white picket fence and kids; the “American dream”. But as I grew up I learned that this wasn’t true at all, and nor would I want that to be. My parents divorced when I was 5 and that time was a confusing time for an only child like me especially when I started living full time with my dad. It was a big change for my dad and I, but a complete 180 for him. But on the plus side we moved into a neighborhood with a lot of kids and that’s where the story of how I met the rest of my family begins. Being an only child meant I had to find my own fun and meet new people it just so happened that I had a whole pool of people around be to be with. My neighborhood was a mix of a whole bunch of different kids from different backgrounds and walks of life but somehow we all just meshed together. My best friend Chloe and I were always the oldest so we were like older sisters to everyone helping them with HW or whatever they needed. Felix my other best friend was the older brother. Hayley, Adian, Life, Sarah, and Lauren were the youngest so we watched out for them. We all would spend countless hours outside playing “pretend” games and just run around sometimes from sun up till sun down. The winter time was full of snowball fights, snowmen, and hot chocolate movie times.  Soon it just became normal to see each other in our houses it wasn’t “Can Chloe come over?” is was “Chloes here!” The time that I lived there with my neighborhood family yeiled some of the greatest memories that I have today. They shaped me into the person I am today and I am forever thankful. They taught me how to help others, have fun, and that family doesn’t always have to be blood related. They changed my definition of family. I didn’t want that to end but of course times change and people started to move and the neighborhood got quiet but our dynamic has never changed. To this day I still consider them my family just as much as my dad is. This I believe, that family is what you make of it and sometimes family is not always blood related.   ","100000140"

I believe in work.  I believe that one must work for what is important to them. This type of work could be for grades, money, trust, or even happiness. I was raised being told that work ethic was important, and now as I am older I truly understand how important it is. 
When I was 10 I asked for a dog. The answer was, as expected, a no. I decided maybe a dog was not for me, but was determined to find another pet. That is when I did some research and found the perfect pet for me, a potbellied pig. Wide eyed and determined, I called my dad into the kitchen to explain my idea. “Dad, I understand we do not have the time for a dog, but what about a pig?” And without hesitation my dad looked at me and stated, “You learn how to take care of a pig, speak to vets, determine what they need to live, and write an essay on all the information you find, then you can have a pig.” And so it began. Weeks followed as my ten-year-old self found information online, spoke to vets over the phone, speaking to farmers and feed stores. I learned from where potbellied pigs lived, to what they ate, to the types of personality’s they have. I compiled all this information into an essay which I types and printed to give to my dad. He read it over, asked me a few questions and declared I could get a pig. 
8 years later, my pig Moo is still with us and happy. He lived in our house for the first 7 months and was litter box trained. He now has a barn outside where he enjoys a kiddy pool and soccer balls to play with.
Getting Moo was the first time I realized how strong my belief of work was. I realized then that I knew I had to work for anything I needed, and knew that I could do anything as long as I put my time and effort into it. Now that I am older I understand that the work I put into school, my jobs, and even my relationships show my dedication to what I do. I understand why my dad allowed me to get a pig, because he knew that if I cared enough to work for it then I was mature enough to take care of it.
I was raised to be an independent person, who can do for themselves. Because of this I feel more mature, and responsible. This belief of work helps me do good in school, grow strong relationships, and gain respect for others who see my dedication.

I believe that if I am afraid to struggle at something new in my life, then I will never succeed. I have noticed that when I struggle through something in my life, I become a better person in the end. I struggle and push myself past my comfort zone to reach the top. If something doesn’t go right through my pathway, why not try looking at it differently? If something doesn’t work the first time, that doesn’t mean you should give up. 
When I was ten years old, I tried out for the dance company at the dance studio near my house. At this time, I had only been dancing for seven years. I felt like the youngest girl in the audition room because everyone looked so much older than me; my thought process was correct. The other girls that were also auditioning for the same group were older than me by a few years. Some of the girls were in the 8th grade, and some were in their sophomore year in high school. I felt very young being the only 5th grader in the audition. I wanted to pursue my dream and be a part of this dance company, so I didn’t let the age gap between the girls and me keep me from auditioning. To my surprise, I was accepted onto the team at the age of ten years old when the dance instructors that are the executive directors of the company were looking for girls from the age of 12 years old to 18 years old. I felt very happy that I didn't give up and I didn't let the struggle of not having the same number of years of training like the other girls did keep me from auditioning. 
Throughout my first year in the dance company, I pushed myself out of my comfort zone and made new friends. An example of when I pushed myself in dance class was when I finally had the opportunity to start partnering with a boy. Being ten years old at the time, I was still very immature and thought that boys still had cooties. I never thought of holding a boy’s hand at school, now I have to do partner work and have a boy hold my waist above his head. It was very uncomfortable and it took time to get used to since I was officially in the dance company and partner work was a normal thing to do. I failed multiple times in lifts in many performances and rehearsal that year, but I worked more and more in and out of dance class with my partner so that we could get the difficult lifts in the dance. One of my tricks that I learned throughout the eight years of being in the dance company and doing many different styles of partner work, if I didn’t want my hand or my body to be sweating and slippery, I would hairspray my body and my hands before a rehearsal or a performance. Now, in my dancing career, I love to do partner work. In my senior year of high school, I was praised on how far I have come in partner work and how much chemistry I can portray to the audience while dancing. 
Dance has been a struggle in many scenarios, but I have always pushed myself past my comfort zone to show myself that I can do more. In the end, I hoped that I would succeed, but I had to struggle and fail multiple times before getting to the end point of my goal.  I believe that if I am afraid to struggle at something new in my life, then I will never succeed. I will always try and push myself past my comfort zone, and possibly struggle, to reach the top.

I believe that you should treat people the way you want to be treated. Everyone should treat everyone, and their ideas and opinions, with at least the most basic respect. Regardless of skin color, religion, beliefs, looks, anything, everyone should treat each other just as they would want to be treated- with respect. There has been so many issues lately regarding groups of people shaming other groups for what they believe in or how they look; This is the most ignorant form of disrespect anyone could ever display. Just because someone does not believe the same things you do or is going through what you are, does not give you the right to disrespect their beliefs or advice, their opinion is just as valid as yours is. Every summer I go to a horseback riding camp in New Hampshire for the month of July. It is an all girls sleep away camp that girls from ages 8-16 attend from all around the world. There is always a wide range of opinions and beliefs in every single conversation, sometimes even language barriers making every interaction with anyone just as interesting as it can be. One afternoon, I was talking with my friends about how how some girls were moved up into the higher level and some girls had been kept down low instead of moving up like they should have. My friends and I were all experienced riders at the top level, and were talking to two girls from Spain who barely spoke English, trying to make them feel better about being placed into the second highest ring, telling them how we were once in their place too. The language barrier was hard enough to deal with, so everyone was a little aggravated already, but, there was a younger girl sitting next to us listening on to our conversation. At one point, she leaned over and told the girls to not worry about it so much, and that they’ll move up when the time is right. The girls from Spain were upset enough, so they yelled back at her in very broken English that she does not understand how aggravating being held down is, and since she always has been in the lowest level of riding she does not understand. They screamed at her that all their friends are in the highest level and they are alone just below them all because they are just not good enough to make the cut, while she is at the bottom with all of her friends and has nothing to worry about. Their sudden harshness upset the little girl so much that she ran off scared and crying after just trying to help them feel better. This made me think, if the Spanish girls will not accept the little girl’s opinion and advice because she was not at the same riding level as they were, and was not going through the same difficulties as them, her opinion was invalid. If this is a basic and natural belief for teenage girls to act upon, they must hold the same attitude when it comes to more serious issues like accepting gay marriage, or accepting different religions trying to prove their legitimacy to others. If those same two girls were having a conversation about whether or not they think gay marriage should be legal, and a lesbian tried to give her opinion, would they yell at her saying they do not want her opinion because she is not straight so she is not going through the same difficulties choice wise as they are? I believe everyone should treat people the way they want to be treated, and that everyone’s opinion matters no matter what. Just because someone is not the same as you, or does not hold the same beliefs, that does not mean their argument is any more valid or invalid as yours is. If we all treat people equally and with as much respect and acceptance as possible, the world would be a much happier place.","100000144"

I believe that everyone is born equal and no one should think they better than anyone else. Everyone wants to be better than someone else and this steams from their own insecurities. But if you love yourself, then you won’t seek out the pleasure of making some feel low for your own selfish high. This is prevalent in my age group and with the use of social media it doesn’t help, we are constant in competition with others. We compete to have the best body, relationship, jobs, etc. If we don’t get the spot light or the recognition, we want for being perfect in the eyes of others than we lash out and hurt our self and those around us. You start to feel low and start question yourself worth and the love others have for you. The reason why this is my belief is that during the beginning of my high school years I felt less of a person and that I don’t matter as much because I wasn’t perfect. That I was less than my friend and everyone else. In middle school I was a very awkward child. I was bigger than most girls my age, my hair was big and curly, and because I came from a low income family I didn’t have the most fashion forward clothing. And this weird middle schooler only got older and more awkward and before I knew it I was in high school. In middle school it was acceptable to be like this, but in high school it wasn’t. I felt like everyone got the upgrade and I was left behind. My freshman year was terrible, my friends had hit puberty and to top it off they had boyfriends who almost worshipped the ground the walked on, while I was stuck eating at my lunch table all alone. This affect my self-esteem so much and but me in such a funk, I felt the whole world was against me and I couldn’t escape it because everyone’s happy life was plastered everywhere on social media. But what I didn’t notice was that my depression was affecting everyone else around me. During Christmas break my great grandmother sat me down and told me what she had to go through when she my age. She had to compete with girls her own age but not only on looks but with basic human right. When she was younger she lived in Mississippi and had to deal with racism at every turn. She would have to tell herself that she was beautiful and unique, as well as that she had the same right as everyone else, even when ignorance was in her face screaming disgusting racist comments in her face. And I took this to heart, from that point I changed how I view myself and my life. I realized that I come from strong women and that  no one can tell me if I’m not beautiful because as long as I love my self and believe in myself, I am perfect. ","100000146"

I have recently begun to hold to the belief that no matter how much of a struggle it is to get over an obstacle, whether a personal problem or school work, as long as you believe you will make it through; nothing can stop you. Thought is the very first step to an accomplishment in any situation. There are times when it can be difficult to believe in yourself and your skills but you will never know what you can do until you try with all your energy and will. I have had moments where my anxiety over certain tasks has kept me from opportunities and I have told myself over and over from those days “no more.” No more doubting whether I can make it. No more doubting my own judgement. No more relying on other people to confirm if I am right or wrong. I am my own person and only I can be me.
In psychology, they termed this the “self-fulfilling destiny.” It is when a person believes they can attain something and then they work until they make the belief true. Of course it is easier to commit to a task when you are not weighed down by believing you will fail before you begin. How could you ever accomplish something when you think from the start there is no way for you to do so? Each person gets to decide what their limits are, so why would you ever want to create those limitations before you have ever tried anything? It can be that the mindset a person chooses for him or herself that is the determining factor in their success or failure. 
I struggled with this terribly in high school, specifically with Chemistry. No matter what I tried I simply could not follow the teacher and his way of giving instructions. I began to believe I could never do will in Chemistry and my D average reflected that mindset. Doing so terribly in the class even made me doubt what I had always planned to do with my life, go into a science field. Halfway through the year though I switched teachers in a last ditch effort to salvage something of the grade; even if I still did not get the material. The new teacher I had, however, was dedicated to having her students understand everything they were taught. Dr. Savery made me believe in my own ability again and my grade in her class quickly flipped around to A’s. She showed me the importance of not giving up or degrading my own efforts as futile. She is the one that has shaped my beliefs as well as renewing the belief in myself and my skills in science courses.","100000147"

I believe that hard work and dedication pays off. All my life I have never been part of the team and I was a mediocre student in middle school and early high school. Once I hit junior and senior year, I decided I wanted to prove to myself I could do better in sports and in school. Pushing myself taught me I can go above and beyond what I thought I was capable of. If you are willing to push yourself then you will do better. 
I started hitting the books more in my free time. This opened up my eyes. I found out I actually loved reading which I used to hate as a kid. I also found out that I am a procrastinator. In high school I started to mess with my scheduling on my agenda when it came to projects and test. I would bump things up so I could be prepared instead of waiting till the night before. I got my grades to all As and Bs and finished out high school with a bang. 
In high school I never really was on a team, I came to college and wanted to get back into rowing and continue rowing. I had been rowing for a year but it was just at a club and I never raced. I got way more into it over summer and this year in college. When I train harder, I get better. For example. When I first started rowing my split times (how long it takes you to row 500 meters) for erging were 2:45(this means It takes me two minutes and forty-five seconds to complete a 500 meter piece) today I had a 5k erg assessment and I got a 2:13.5. (2 minutes and 13 seconds to complete a 500 meter piece) I have worked my butt off to get down to that and hopefully the next time I row a 5k I will get a lower score. 
Working hard has a remarkable payoff. If you work for something, you will do well. There is no way around this, but If you do not work hard, you won't like your results. I pushed myself harder senior year than I ever did in school. I'm going to start using these techniques again so I can get my grades higher. I need to keep my grades up in order to row and I know that if I work hard and set aside time to actually get stuff done and to work, then I will be able to score higher. This is a motto I live by because of the outcomes I have witnessed when doing my work to the full potential I can do it.

I am not the kind of person that does a lot of self-reflection, but if i am to say what my beliefs are, I know that I believe in tolerance, forgiveness, humility but most importantly, I believe in peace. Coming from a very war-torn country, I know to achieve this would be difficult cause humans are so different from each other even if with shared race and religion. In this school naturally the center for nonviolence and peace study interested me.I attended the Peacebuilding and Diversity in the Tamil Nadu and Nagaland State of India speech presented by Dr.Paul Bueno de Mesquita and his wife, Kay Johnson. They gave speeches about their experiences on the business/tour tip. They talked about the difference in cultures; how about 60-80% of marriages in India are arranged.They also covered disturbing facts about the country like; 70% of married women in India suffer domestic violence, 55% of all women in India faced family violence and abuse and lastly 67% child abuse in terms of sexual assaults. One of the highlights of the speech was them meeting Gandhi's great grandson. With all said, it was a really great speech, and by the end, I felt like I have gotten a deeper insight about the lifestyle in India. 
During the diversity week, for my URI 101 class, I decided to attend Professor Kimberle Crenshaw’s speech about Race, Reform and New Retrenchment. Although, she wasn’t directly talking about peace, her speech about how equality can be achieved was really resourceful and informative; one that made me self reflect a lot.I realized that I tend to think that a problem isn’t mine to solve since it doesn’t affect me directly; she called it “The Frame”; meaning if the frame (situation) was different and it visualizes the direct effect it would have on the society as a whole, everyone would react differently than if they thought it only affected a certain group of people. Throughout the night she went on to talk about blacks lives matter, affirmative action, structural racism and white privilege, color blind framing of racial inequality and even the presidential debate that happened the previous night,but the activity she engaged the audience in, before the end of her speech, is what shook me the most. She introduced her last section which was “Intersectional Erasure”, but before she elaborated, she asked all the people present to stand up. Explaining the activity, she would call out a few names and anyone who doesn’t know the name mentioned would sit down, until the last person standing. When she began, she called out names that were really prominent in the blacks lives matter movement; names of those killed by the police; names like Michael Brown, Freddie Gray, Tamir Rice and Alton Sterling.  As she called the names, few people sat down, and I remembered looking around not believing that some people haven’t heard of the tragedies. As she moves down the list, more and more people (including myself), sat down. Then she made her points; the latter part of the names in which everyone sat down were cases about police brutality against black women. This is what she called “Intersectional Erasure”; how an equally tragic death wasn’t as popular and seemed to be erased (even in the movement) based on the gender of the victim. She then went ahead to show us a video called “Say Her Name”; The video contained such disturbing scenes, that it chilled the entire audience. That video was still (and till this day) vivid in my mind, hopefully the video would get more attention, and more people would be aware. I enjoyed both of the sessions I attended; I got to see India through the eyes of Mr Paul and his wife, Kay and I also gained immense knowledge that encouraged me to be more aware, through the powerful speech of Ms. Kimberlé Williams Crenshaw.

Something that I strongly belief in is that men should not look down on women and doubt their abilities. This is something that I deal with in some way or another almost every day, along with every other woman. I have faced this issue in many different realms, including classrooms, sports fields, physical education classes, etc. I am a strong believer that women can do everything men can do, and sometimes even better. I am not a huge feminist, but it is unfair for women to be stepped all over and doubted. 
A personal experience from my earlier years I have dealing with this happened back in sixth grade. We were playing floor hockey that week in my physical education class, and we could choose who we wanted to be on our team to play two on two. My best friend, Katie, and I were on a team together, and we happened to be in a class with a lot of boys. Every time we faced a team with all boys, they always had a look of confidence on their faces, thinking that the game would be an easy win for them. However, Katie and I were, and still are, very competitive athletes and are not fazed by anything. We started off with a bang and dominated many teams that we played. The fact that our abilities as athletes were doubted gave us the motivation to work even harder and beat the boys. The look of shock and disappointed from the boys was the best feeling, and we were very proud of ourselves. 
Not only have I been doubted as an athlete, but I have also been doubted as a student. It has happened numerous times, both in big and small ways. One of the more recent cases happened not too long ago, actually in my biology 101 lecture. We were taking a group quiz, and every time I suggested an answer, I was doubted by one of my male group mates. I felt confident in my answers, and I even had my notes out to back up my answers. Yet, my group mate would say that I am wrong, and call out to another male student a few seats down and ask what he thought the answer was. Sure enough, the answers I suggested were the same as the ones the other student said. When we found out we got the answer correct, the student that doubted me would not apologize and gave credit to the other student. This really rubbed me the wrong way, but I just decided to let the situation be and not say anything about it. 
My belief that men should not look down on women is something that, unfortunately, many women have to deal with. However, that is not to say that every man is guilty of doing so. Many men are supportive of women, and hopefully one day all men will think of women as equals.","100000015"

Originally when I was going to write this essay, I thought it would be on happy endings. Once upon a time I used to believe in them, but as I grew older and experienced life I learned that not everyone gets a happy ending. Instead, this essay is going to be about hope, hope is a powerful driving force in the world, just having hope is a powerful thing for most people. I don’t want to make some speech, saying that my belief is more justified than another person’s, as that is simply not true. Everyone is allowed to have their own feelings, opinions, and beliefs, and to say mine is above theirs is presumptuous of me.
Throughout our lives we will eventually hit a rough patch, though this may be cynical no one can deny it is the truth, When I was in high school my family hit a rough patch in our lives that threatened to tear us apart. My dad was discovered of being unfaithful to my mother for many years. This discovery put an intense strain on my family, my parents kept on fighting for years over this and it looked like it would stay that way. I just tried to hold onto hope in this situation, though it was hard to do form the toxic relationship that built up from the fighting. Eventually my dad moved out of the house and everything started to look better. A few years later and my parents finally divorced and can actually be civil together. The strain on my family’s relationship will always be there, but it gets easier to deal with in time. The relationship with my dad will never be the same as the one before his secret was discovered, but I’m happy to still have him in my life. 
What I’m trying to say here is that holding onto hope is the most important thing anyone can do. Many other people can identify with my situation of being in a toxic family, if I didn’t have hope I probably would have fallen into depression. There was so much fighting going on for years, back and forth, spewing one hateful comment after another. I wasn't sure that I could handle seeing two people who I love dearly, rip each other’s throat out. Thankfully I had my friends to help me through this point in my life, as many of them had been through the same thing. This allowed me to escape and think, which allowed me to hope. Many people in this world do not have hope, their lives are so fundamentally different from mine, that i could never truly understand them. Hope is always the same though, it why we see change today. Just a little hope is all anyone needs in life, because believing that things will get better is sa powerful thing indeed.

For years people have claimed seeing flying objects in the sky. These strange flying objects are UFO’s and they visit our planet regularly. Many different countries around the world have their own records of sighting of UFO’s. Television, movies, books, real life stories and ancient cave paintings have all supported the fact that aliens exist. Ancient hieroglyphs described how they saw strange beings come down from the sky. I strongly believe that aliens do exist and that these UFO’s visit Earth on a regular basis. I believe that Earth is not the only planet that has life form on it. Our galaxy is too big to not believe there are other life forms living out there. I think that out in our universe there is a planet or even planets that are homes to these aliens. Every year the amount of near collisions with UFO’s increase. There are countless reports of planes that have witnessed UFO’s on their ride. There have been many reported sightings and there's also been times where events have occurred and the government has tried to cover it up. I think the government is hiding the evidence of aliens. For example there is a United States Air Force facility in Nevada known as Area 51. The facility's purpose is unknown or kept secret because there is historical evidence that it is used to test extraterrestrial aircrafts. With the intense security and secrecy about the facility it is obvious that the government is trying to hide something from the public. Countless times NASA has tried to cover up events and this leads people to believe they are hiding the fact that aliens exist. Not only is the government hiding these facts from us but so are astronauts. Astronauts have the best chance of sighting aliens when they are on a mission. However it is said that these astronauts are sworn to secrecy if they are to encounter one on their trip. The government doesn't want to start panic with the facts that there is life outside of earth. If humans knew there was another planet outside of Earth that could be accessed there would be people trying to leave to explore and this new planet. People have reported their own experience of aliens making an appearance on earth and probing humans. Astronomers have done the math and calculated that there should be thousands if not millions of other planets that are capable of having life on them. I have a few other friends who I became closer ith over this topic because it gets us so freaked out about what we are not being told. There is rock hard evidence that aliens exist and the government needs to tell the public about what they are keeping secret from us. This universe is too big to have just one planet with living creatures on it. We should know what else is out there. ","100000151"

The Paranormal. When I moved into my second house at the age of three, my life had changed forever. The whole property had a hidden secret that only my parents had known about, even prior to purchasing the house. The house was in a private neighborhood, in a wealthy town, but was oddly cheap for the location. Cheap for a reason. The neighborhood was called Tokeneke, named after a former Native American Reservation where the natives had taken refuge when Europeans invaded Connecticut. Overtime the Tokeneke tribe were pushed off their reservation and their land was taken over. Today I know the truth behind that house and the truth was that right on my property was where the tribe held their burial ground.
Though I was too young to remember most of what went down, I do remember the energy of the place and hot spots of the house that were more negatively charged than others, along with a few minor incidents. My mom is and always has been very sensitive to the paranormal. She has told me of multiple experiences she had gone through in the house, some being “to dreadful” to talk about. Being one of four siblings in my family, my parents got to witness how each of us had reacted to what was going on. My mom had told me that it was me who was most sensitive to the house. I remember experiencing noises and hearing voices that had no source, the TV turning on by itself every time I went to play the GameCube, and an overwhelming sense of dread coming from my closet, and the downstairs guest room. I remember until I was ten years old I was afraid to go upstairs and downstairs by myself.
After we had moved out of the house when I was nine, my mom had inspired me to gain a great interest in the paranormal. I found myself reading books of scary stories, and watching TV shows like, A Haunting, Paranormal Witness, Ghost Hunters, Destination Truth, etc. the list goes on. All of these sources, along with what I had experienced in the house lead to me to
solidify my belief of the paranormal. I believe that ghosts are just the energy of people who have passed and have difficulty moving on, because they cannot fully accept that they are dead.
They are simply confused, and lost in time and space. When energy is available for them to absorb whether it be in the form of strong living human emotion, or even electrical devices, they can make themselves known to the living. As for demonic entities, they do exist. I can’t prove that there is a hell but there are entities out there that are beyond human understanding. Though I have never experienced these entities first hand, and hope to never do, I believe they do exist. As for angels, I believe that they are more discreet. I feel they are simply are responsible for most miracles that occur. All in all, I feel that I still don’t have a grasp on understanding the paranormal, but this is simply what I believe, based on my experiences, and what I have absorbed.","100000152"

The Power of self-Love. I believe in the power of self-love and self-acceptance. I remember a day back in 6th grade that dropped my self-esteem to its lowest point. I was a chubby pre-teen, I was a little more “developed” than most of the other girls that I knew, and I had horrible acne. I went through medication after medication, from Proactiv, to an acne medication called murad that my mom could only afford in trial sizes because it was so expensive, to prescriptions. I was insecure, but everyone was starting to get acne and go through their “ugly stage,” so it wasn’t a major focus for me. That was until one day I was sitting in the cafeteria with my friends when I noticed that students were walking by and they would look at me and laugh with their friends. I didn’t think anything of it until one of my closest friends told me why people were laughing at me. It turns out, two students who I had only interacted with a few times had drawn a picture of me on the white board when their teacher wasn’t in the room.This picture depicted me with crazy hair (my
hair is naturally very curly), red acne dots all over my face, chunky braces, and a blown up body. I was absolutely crushed. I went home crying, and that day was the day that shaped my body image and the way I saw myself for the rest of middle school and high school. I became a very sad individual, and I was envious of every girl that I thought was better than me in any way, and
I was miserable. My negative body image also led into lack of motivation, and lack of confidence in any work that I did. All I wanted to do was lay in bed all day, but doing that just made me think negative things like “you’re so useless,” “all you’re doing is proving that you can’t be like anybody else,” and “you’re not good enough.” Snide comments about my weight, my skin, and my success’s and failures from friends, family, and even strangers only validated all of the negative things that I would say about myself. However, this past year I have been trying to find myself and re-evaluate everything bad I have ever thought about myself. I have
learned that I don’t WANT to be like anybody else the way I did back then, I want to be my own person.  Recently, I have discovered the importance of self love and self acceptance and how much it really does change your everyday life. Today, my acne is cleared up (for the most part), I have perfect teeth, I have grown into my body, I have learned how to maintain my hair, and I am working harder than I ever have before. However, I am still very insecure about my weight and other aspects of  myself because I have been my own worst enemy for the past six years. To help get where I want to be, I have been meeting and surrounding myself with new and interesting people here at URI, I have been getting involved in clubs and learning all types of new things,
and I have been going to the gym with new friends to boost my endorphins and rid the stress of my new schedule. I am still working on becoming 100% comfortable with myself, but the
improvements I have been making in accepting myself have proven to boost my overall mood, my confidence, and my overall happiness.","100000153"

I personally believe in the power of compassion. This concept first came to me while I was growing up among people with serious mental issues and addictions. I myself have struggled with anxiety/depression since I was in middle school. I looked at my family and sometimes saw them do bad things, but I knew they were good people. They just had issues they had to deal
with. I looked at myself and knew I was a good person, I too simply had issues I needed to deal with. This observation made me realize that every human on the planet has their own life and problems, and how they act isn’t always a true representation of who they are. It seems like an obvious thing to know but, as young as I was, it was an absolute revelation. My perception of the world seemed to have changed from a pinhole focused on my life and my friends and family to a high definition view of all humans as one community. All of us are just people with our own
lives and issues, not one of us is perfect. This  lead me to become more compassionate and empathetic towards other humans, no matter how well or bad they treat me in return.
I also believe in the concept that not one being on Earth is better than the other. Just like how my experience with my family changed my view on humans, science changed my view on all living things. During my two years off after high school, I began to become extremely interested in science. Learning about evolution and what being alive is made me realize that every living thing on Earth is in the same boat: we are all here and don’t know why for fact, and we are all literally related to each other. I mean we all share a common ancestor! At the time,
these facts were mind-blowing and they made me realize that, no matter how much we like to think we are, humans are not superior to any other living thing. We simply happened to evolve into highly intelligent creatures.
It seems to me that humans look at nature and think that we own it, but in reality we are simply a part of it, and if anything our evolutionary advantages provide us with a responsibility
to not only be compassionate towards each other but to all living things. Due to these core beliefs of mine, I have chosen a career path that incorporates both compassion and awareness. I have chosen to work in the field of wildlife conservation biology because my beliefs push me to look after and help living things that haven’t received compassion from human beings. All of the species that we are endangering due to our careless attitudes towards the environment need help, and I am honored to have the opportunity to provide them with that. And I sincerely believe that
if more humans practiced compassion and a scientific understanding of the world on a daily basis, not only would the environment be restored, but we would be closer to world peace than we have ever been before.","

I grew up in a very irish-catholic family… a good example of a moral/mindset of this category of the catholic religion is that “it’s a sin to drink and it’s a sin to spill your beer”... I know this little joke sounds very stereotypical but it’s ok because I'm one of them so I'm allowed to joke about it. Now that I have your attention, I feel that my catholic upbringing has shaped me to have a certain mindset of different situations. I have always believed that it is a good thing to love others the way you love yourself, to be thankful for the things you have and to love the life you were given, and to pay good deeds forward. Aside from my personal beliefs of God, Jesus, and general religion specific views, I think that the morals I have gained from going to church on Sundays for my whole life can be valid for almost anyone regardless of their religious or personal beliefs. I am pretty confident in this statement because there has been a time in my life where I was unsure if I truly believed in the Catholic religion; so, I decided to research other religions and try to understand how the rest of the world and religions view life; what we value as humans, where we go when we die, all the different variations and views on “higher powers”, reincarnation, scientific explanations, and so much more. Although I am very glad I had that stage of my life and was able to learn so much about the world and explanations of why I’m here and who created me and my purpose on this Earth, I found myself back in Catholicism. After I realized catholicism was the religion for me, I was confirmed into the religion. Then I was able to take my morals from the catholic religion and put them into action. With my parish at home, I feel very lucky to have gone on two mission trips. The first to the H.O.M.E. Co-op compound in Maine to work with an extremely poverty stricken community; helping with the daycare, markets, landscape, and anything else they needed. However my most recent and impactful trip was to the Dominican Republic. While I was there, I was able to stay at The Mustardseed Orphanage and Community with over 20 orphans that were severely disabled with cerebral palsy, Down's Syndrome,  psychomotor delays, mental impairment, autism, epilepsy, physical deformations, deafness and blindness and a community heavily stricken with poverty and hardship. It was a very hard thing to witness however I feel that my morals of loving all people regardless of their abilities, background, or beliefs, being thankful for the things I have and to give to those who have nothing, and paying good deeds forward has really made this trip so much more effective and made my beliefs so much more real and valid in my everyday life. Although I think that every person should find a religion that they connect with on their own personal level, I personally feel very proud to be a Catholic.

“Cherish the moment.” It may just be an old cliche to most people, but it is a belief that I strongly support. I never gave much thought to this belief until a recent incident occurred that really put things into perspective for me. Just over a week ago a childhood friend of mine experienced a murder in his family. His brother Dylan (who was only 23 years young) had suffered from a gunshot wound to his head. This was my first encounter with a tragedy this drastic.
Attending his wake was another first for me. As I waited in line to see the casket I was struck by an odd vibe of sorrow and nostalgia. Being surrounded by all of the photos, sad music, and people in mourning wore me down to tears. When I finally approached the casket I was hit by reality. The lifeless body of someone I once knew laid right in front of me. I said a prayer and shared my heartbreak with the family on my way out. That night the thought of a daughter that will never see her father again haunted me. The image of his 13 year old sister crying
hysterically was plastered in my mind. They never seen this coming, and there is nothing they can do about it. All that remains are the memories they cherish.
Although this situation occurred just over a week ago, it changed my view on life forever. Lately I’ve been noticing how self absorbed and isolated I am towards the rest of my family. I cringe at the thought of it. The amount of time that I spent keeping to myself could have been memories in the making right downstairs from me. I didn’t see it then, but it’s bright as day to
me now. I’ll never know when my last encounter with a loved one will be, or the last time I’ll get to tell them “I love you.” All I know is that right now, I have the opportunity to spend time with my family whenever I want, and I’m not going to take that for granted.
As I grow older I’m progressively realizing what “real life” is all about. The days are passing faster than I can count, and familiar faces are increasingly becoming vague. No one is going to be around forever and you truly never know the last time you’ll see someone. I plan to keep my friends and family close to my heart and cherish every moment possible because time waits for no man.","

I believe that one truly can never go wrong by doing the right thing. What harm can be done by doing good. No harm no foul. I remember once when I was a freshman in high school my best friend got jumped by a group of girls. Seemingly for no reason.
Girls can be ruthless. Anyway, I had been around when it happen and the principal called me to his office to ask me some questions about the girls that did it and at first I was super scared. I didn’t want to rat anyone out, for fear that they might come after me next, but then I thought about how they had hurt my best friend and how she could benefit from me telling the truth about the girls and what exactly it was that I saw.
So I ended up telling the principle everything and anything I knew about what transpired before and after the fight. Later on I would find out the girls had gotten either expelled or suspended as they were repeat offenders. After that I felt kind of bad for telling on them, but I knew that justice had been aptly served and everything had gone as it should have. My friend was hurt, and probably emotionally scarred for the rest of her life, but the threat was no longer a threat.
All because I had done the right thing and stuck with my gut. Sometimes in life it seems as if you have no choice but to do the right thing because you know that it could have good long lasting effects. Had I not told the principal about what I knew, those girls still would have been roaming the halls of my school, terrorizing any innocent girl the felt like terrorizing.
Not only did I help my friend, I also helped prevent this from happening to other girls. I stopped drama from occurring for the rest of the year. There’s something satisfying about doing the right thing, honestly. It’s a personal pleasure. There are times, of course when doing the right thing can be questioned. Like for instance, when you have a quiz on a friday but it’s thursday night, you have no homework and all of your friends are going out. Obviously you’re going to want to go out with them. Follow the crowd.
Who wants to miss out on fun when everyone else is having fun. But deep down inside you know that you need to be in the library or in a study lounge going over your notes because you’ve already failed two quizzes and you can’t afford to fail another one. So you go out, but when you get back it’s too late and you’re tired so you don’t study.
The next day you have a quiz and you can’t answer the first question. This has happened to me, and I instantly regretted it. It’s hard now that i’m in college to do the right thing because nobody is here to hold my hand and scold me telling me “you shouldn’t do that” i’m in an adult world now, and it’s up to me to make adult decisions.
So instead of going back to my room during my free time after class, i’m working on finishing any homework that I can handle. I’m in the library for a good seven hours because that’s when I feel the most satisfied. I believe that if you work hard enough to do the right thing, in the end it will have a good effect.","100000158"

I am confused by the wording of the assignment.  By “my beliefs” I’m not sure if that means my religious beliefs, my philosophy, or my core values.  The first thing that comes to mind is that I believe in myself, and life is too short so I gotta stay positive, enjoy the moment and not let people or events bring me down. My core beliefs come from where I grew up, in a secluded house surrounded by woods in Chepachet, Rhode Island. Though out my whole life I’ve always felt a connection to the woods. Always exploring and hiking, I became an eagle scout in my local boy scout troop because I enjoy camping and nature a lot.   Senior year of high school I wrote a short film called “Woods Boy” about me living in the woods and surviving and such.  Nature is one of my big beliefs, and that influenced me choosing Environmental Management as my major. Other core beliefs come my home life of course.  I’m close with my two siblings, I have two sisters, and I’m the middle child.  To my parents I’ve always felt like I was stuck in-between my sisters. My older sister was first for everything and my younger sister gets whatever she wants.  So really that’s how I learned to not worry about what happens in life and just go with what I can’t control.  The one most important thing my mother ever taught me was always try my hardest and that what happens, happens. My older sister was sent to a Catholic high school when she became a freshman, so my parents sent me there too my freshman year.  I was raised Catholic, but as I went through high school taking religion classes every day. I decided to leave the church because I didn’t agree with it.  I still graduated from that Catholic high school, but my choice to not practice that religion any more has affected my family life. It’s hard to get into the details, but I am not close with my mother anymore because of that and a few other life choices.  Another one of my core beliefs is kinda selfish, but I believe that I have to live for myself and believe in myself to make myself happy before others, which is a core satanic belief. What I believe is a really important area of my life is my involvement in music.  I taught myself how to play the electric guitar over the past three years, by listening to heavy metal music daily and putting in a lot of effort to practice at least two hours each day, sometimes all day.  My best friend Mitch is a drummer who shares the same belief as me.  Everyone needs a hobby, and creating loud music is our hobby.  Heavy metal is such a big part of my life that I would consider it my religion, and I would say that the best moment of my life was when I got to perform with my band in front of my whole school. Over all I don’t have a specific belief but if I had to choose what is most important to me I would say my family, my music, nature and myself.

Belief is hard. As the prompt says an essay like this takes intense self-examination, something I really did not prefer doing. It's hard to find something you believe in because beliefs change every day, one day you don't know something and live with one assumption and the next day you learn something new and it changes your beliefs it changes your way of thinking.
People live with different assumptions and through these assumptions they form their own reality which makes belief a hard thing to pin down and say here's my belief. I guess, you could say that my belief, the thing I believe at my core is that beliefs are every changing and people including myself have to change with the times to “survive”.
So where did this somewhat cynical view on belief come from, how does a kid of only 19 have such weird views on life and things that compose it. I think my view on that people have to change with the time to adapt and survive comes from my prior knowledge in science really. Ever since I was a kid I've loved things such as comic books and superheroes. Those heroes and villains lived in a world of science more than faith and if you're a ten years old boy and want to be a superhero when you grow up, you'll choose the same path those heroes did to become like them. I believed more in science than in other more spiritual things. I didn't find comfort in things such as religion or faith so I chose science. Taking classes in high school you learn that animals including humans have adapted and evolved to survive the environment, I think that where this belief of mine originated, if you didn't move forward with the times and adapt you will be left behind in life and in the biological sense die.
The prompt says that I should pick a specific time where my belief was challenged and changed or created but I don't really have a story like that instead I would like to mention what I think my belief could do for the world. Many people not only in the United States but in the world have trouble adapting to a new time, a new age and that can cause a lot of problems for people. It happens every time a little kid is turning into an adult they clash with their parents over how they see events and how they want to live there life based on the current norms. This is one example to me that if people moved forward and evolved their beliefs problems like those wouldn't exist or would be quickly resolved. The american people are going through a tough
time right now with the current elections, people's beliefs are being tested and instead of people updated their beliefs and looking to the future people are focused on the past ad turning back the clock instead of updating and evolving for a better future.
An old saying that I really like is the tree that doesn't bend breaks. I think that explains my belief perfectly people even me at times are so fixated on a certain outcome that we ignore things right in front of us and get stuck in place not moving forward. I understand that this is certainly an unorthodox method to answering a prompt about belief, I spent a lot of my essay talking about my belief with other people and how it could benefit them and the truth is I really believe it can. I can't give you the day I thought of this belief or how besides the vague things I remember about my childhood shaped this belief, however what I can tell you is I truly believe that people including myself need move forward trying to get to new places, trying reaching new heights, pushing to cure diseases once thought incurable, finding new ways to tap the ocean depths, all these things are possible when people start opening their minds to the possibilities and discovering that we shape the reality we live in.","100000016"

Something that I believe to be true is that no matter what obstacle is put in front of you, or how bad any situation is, there will always be something or someone to help you through. To back up my belief I chose three examples with stories to them. The first example is schoolwork. Anyone can tell you that transitioning from high school to college is one of the hardest things a new college student could go through. The work is a lot different, a lot harder, and overall you just have to be a more independent person. This example can relate to me because I have been having a really hard time with my classes and struggling to keep up with the work. So to help me with this struggle, I will go to SI sessions, read chapters over, or study and work with other people to get a different view on ideas. It definitely does not make the work 1000 times easier and make it so that I can fly through the homework. But it does help and it does give me a better understanding of what a morning. Now that I’m a little less stressed it makes completing my work easier and makes me a happier person and I feel productive. My second example is social life. This one isn't as severe as schoolwork, but it still does have an impact on someone's life. My backstory is I tend to be a shy person and I tend to keep to myself. That's how I've been my whole life and it's just what I find more comfortable for me. But I want to step outside my comfort zone and get to know more people and become more social. So in high school I decided to join some sports teams and clubs to help me get to know the people around me. Going into college is a lot harder because you have to make completely new friends. So I decided to join a club, the outing club, and a sorority to help me. I can say that this was the best I can say that this was the best decision of my life because it made the transition a lot easier, decision of my life because it made the transition a lot easier, and I am never bored.  My last example is relationship issues. For this example I actually have a pretty recent story. For the past couple of weeks I have been having roommate issues. My roommate and I are so similar that we butt heads too often. So lately we've been getting into a lot of fights to the point where we call each other harsh things, she's made me cry, etc. I feel that relationship issues really plays a big factor on your overall work outcome and your social life too. Because if you're going through relationship issues your mind is in another place and you're distracted from other things around you. So to overcome this obstacle I decided one, to toughen up be the bigger person, and two, vent to my best friend. So I stopped retaliating with my roommate and told her that we're living together, and as adults should be civil towards each other whether or not we necessarily like each other. And instead of fighting with her further I vented everything I needed to my best friend. It helped me get out my anger so I wouldn't take it out on my roommate. Overall, the main point is that no matter how bad things can get, there's always a supporting thing or person that can help you get through your problems. ","100000160"

Stay True to Yourself. One of the main things I believe in is staying true to yourself. Speak your mind and never lose your self because yourself is what makes you you. With time people do grow and become better, I’m not saying don’t move forward I’m saying to do so but don’t forget what you came from and keep the rules you always set for yourself. Many people seem to get lost on their journey and become a whole different being all together, I seen it happen.
The first step to being yourself is to love yourself. If you know and love yourself you will find it effortless to be true to yourself. Just as you cannot love anyone else until you love yourself, you cannot be true to anyone else until you are true to yourself. Begin by not being afraid to be who you are because the person you are is what makes you special. I believe God put everybody in the world to do his or her own unique and special task chosen for that single person. Leo Buscaglia has been quoted saying, “The hardest battle you’re ever going to fight is the battle to be just you.” When you do things that are not genuine or a reflection of the real you, you will not be happy with yourself and with the outcome. 
When you worry too much about what others think, you leave little room to be yourself. This is one of the things that I sometimes struggle with because I want to literally satisfy everyone. This becomes a problem because each person is different and may see you in a different way of how you truly want to represent yourself. However it always comes down to respecting yourself, when you do that others will respect you. People are able to recognize a strong willed individual. When they sense that you are strong and capable of standing up for yourself and your beliefs they’ll either accept you or not, you just have to leave it as that. 
I found this quote by Ming-Dao Deng and I feel as though this it represents my believes very well. “The moon does not fight. It attacks no one. It does not worry. It does not try to crush others. It keeps to its course, but by its very nature, it gently influences. What other body could pull an entire ocean from shore to shore? The moon is faithful to its nature and its power is never diminished.” ? Ming-Dao Deng.
Be true to the very best of your ability live your life consistent with your highest values and aspirations. Those who are most successful in life have dared to show off there creatively, while expressing themselves in their own unique way while encouraging the people around them to do the same.

I believe that one truly can never go wrong by doing the right thing. What harm can be done by doing good. No harm no foul. I remember once when I was a freshman in high school my best friend got jumped by a group of girls. Seemingly for no reason.
Girls can be ruthless. Anyway, I had been around when it happens and the principal called me to his office to ask me some questions about the girls that did it and at first, I was super scared. I didn’t want to rat anyone out, for fear that they might come after me next, but then I thought about how they had hurt my best friend and how she could benefit from me telling the truth about the girls and what exactly it was that I saw.
So, I ended up telling the principle everything and anything I knew about what transpired before and after the fight. Later on, I would find out the girls had gotten either expelled or suspended as they were repeat offenders. After that I felt kind of bad for telling on them, but I knew that justice had been aptly served and everything had gone as it should have. My friend was hurt, and probably emotionally scarred for the rest of her life, but the threat was no longer a threat.
All because I had done the right thing and stuck with my gut. Sometimes in life it seems as if you have no choice but to do the right thing because you know that it could have good long-lasting effects. Had I not told the principal about what I knew, those girls still would have been roaming the halls of my school, terrorizing any innocent girl the felt like terrorizing.
Not only did I help my friend, I also helped prevent this from happening to other girls. I stopped drama from occurring for the rest of the year. There’s something satisfying about doing the right thing, honestly. It’s a personal pleasure. There are times, of course when doing the right thing can be questioned. Like for instance, when you have a quiz on a Friday but it’s Thursday night, you have no homework and all of your friends are going out. Obviously, you’re going to want to go out with them. Follow the crowd.
Who wants to miss out on fun when everyone else is having fun? But deep down inside you know that you need to be in the library or in a study lounge going over your notes because you’ve already failed two quizzes and you can’t afford to fail another one. So, you go out, but when you get back it’s too late and you’re tired so you don’t study.
The next day you have a quiz and you can’t answer the first question. This has happened to me, and I instantly regretted it. It’s hard now that I’m in college to do the right thing because nobody is here to hold my hand and scold me telling me “you shouldn’t do that” I’m in an adult world now, and it’s up to me to make adult decisions.
So instead of going back to my room during my free time after class, I’m working on finishing any homework that I can handle. I’m in the library for a good seven hours because that’s when I feel the most satisfied. I believe that if you work hard enough to do the right thing, in the end it will have a good effect.","100589227"

I believe hard work is necessary to be successful in life. Since a young age, this phrase has been engraved in my mind. With this drive to do everything to the best of my ability, my work ethic has been shaped into performing at no other level than my hardest. The main events that truly showed me how much success depends on hard work were my school selection experience as well as my rowing career. 
Growing up, I had my dad’s whole side of the family that never got a college education. I always saw college in my future, but I was always intimidated by the fact that half of my family did not take that path. I knew that I was going to have to work extra hard to get myself noticed by schools, so I started early. I took many SAT and ACT prep courses in order to familiarize myself with the layout and types of questions the test contained. The first couple of times I took these tests, my scores were very far from where I wanted them to be, as well as far from the cutoff scores of the schools I was looking at. But I did not give up. Instead, I kept signing up for more practice tests and available tutoring sessions. Eventually, by putting the work in, I got my scores to far above what I thought possible, and it put me ahead of the majority of students applying to the same schools as I. 
Another event that really shaped my determined work ethic was by rowing all throughout high school, and continuing it now on the college team. Rowing is a sport in which mental toughness is necessary for any type of success. It is also a sport that not many can go through with doing, let alone excel in due to the intensity of the work that needs to be put in. The workouts that we do are grueling, and never fail to make you want to give up. During races you need to turn off your mind or else you will shut down from the pain. But when you put in the work, even though you may be in as much pain as you have ever been in, the reward is much greater than the misery you go through. The feeling of self-gratitude that you feel after pushing yourself to your maximum potential is one of the best feelings there is, and that is why I continue to row. This teaches you to buckle down and take the pain in order to prove yourself and show what it takes to compete at the division one level.  
As you can see, these two events have framed my thinking that hard work is necessary in order to obtain success at anything you do. Although these are only two specific events where I display the mentality of dedication to my work, I use that mindset in order to tackle any task that I am faced with. Hard work is most definitely necessary for success. ","100000018"

We are all here to die, in a world where bad things happen, and the people who understand that are free. Nothing in this world is permanent, eventually I’ll die, eventually my family will die, eventually the earth will die, so why bother worrying about it? If something is bound to happen and there’s nothing, I can do to change it, then why would I be scared of it, why would I waste my time being afraid of what’s inevitable? My goal is to live in the present, and to truly know what I have before I lose it again. 
In exactly one month, I will have lived for the past 10 years without my father. He was hit by a car when I was nine years old, and I never really understood what had happened that day until later in my life. My nine-year old mind couldn’t really comprehend what “gone” is, it’s just not something I could understand for what it actually was. I remember the morning that my father was taken to the hospital, I still went to school for about an hour. As I was leaving school, I asked my sister how “dad was doing?” and she replied with “not good”. I laughed. I thought it was a joke. Why would something bad happen to us? I honestly couldn’t describe to you what the following years after his death felt like, it was a blur to me, and it still is a blur to me. My childhood would’ve ended then and there, had it not been for my mother. 

Six years after my father’s passing, my sister was run off the highway, and she flipped her car going 65mph. This was the second time in my life, up until then, that I felt my heart stop, and I was living in the moment. My sister had broken her spine, and was in the ICU for 6 months. I had slept more nights in a hospital, than days I had attended school that year. She survived, with no head injuries, but she is paralyzed from the chest down. 
      
Two years after my sister’s accident, something that is very common for people who went through a loss or tragic event as a young child happened to me. I was diagnosed with depression. What happened was that I got to a point in my life where I was actually able to understand what had happened and all the “lost emotions” basically came back to me at one time. I was half way through my sophomore year at the time, and I was unable to function. There was nothing I wanted to do, I didn’t want to get up, I didn’t want to eat, I didn’t want to move. There was nothing I wanted, and to me at the time there was nothing but an emptiness. Depression is a type of sadness, but it gets to a point where it’s easier to describe it as the absence of emotion. I was a body without a brain. The whole time I was depressed this thing happens where your brain isn’t in control. I was basically forced to think by my own brain. I stayed awake for nights without end thinking of what happened, how, why, why, why, why. It was that same thinking that healed me, and is the basis for my beliefs. From that time, I realized that hey bad shit happens, and it’s happening all the time, and to anyone. Life isn’t fair. I accepted that awful things happen, and when they do happen, I was already prepared for it. I knew it would happen again eventually, so I live in the present and make the most out of whatever happens.
My sister actually goes to URI and is doing amazingly. She’s currently in her second year of her master’s program for nursing, and is already flagged for her doctorates. ","100000019"

I believe you must be resilient in the face of adversity. When I was eight years old I got diagnosed with scoliosis. This condition is believed to be hereditary, since my dad’s father also has this same condition. Scoliosis is when your vertebrae aren’t straight and curve to form a ‘C’ or an ‘S’ shape. I had the ‘S’ shape, and it was actually pretty severe. They measured the actual degrees of the two curves that formed the ‘S’ of my vertebrae. I was a tough little kid, because at the end of my second grade year I was told I would need to wear a back brace for 18 hours a day, seven days a week. For four years straight I wore the brace for 18 hours a day, meaning I slept in that thing, went to school with it on, and played with my friends at recess with it on. When I got into middle school, I was ashamed of my brace since it showed through my clothes and restricted my movement. I only wore it at night during these two years, still continuing my treatment, up until eighth grade when I was told I no longer needed the brace. 
I continued to play sports throughout the six years I wore the brace, taking it off only for soccer practice, dance lessons, skating lessons, and gym class. I can say that sticking with the regimen my orthopedic doctor explained to me really paid off. I learned that no matter what you can’t give up on yourself. Uncomfortable isn’t even a good enough word to describe the back brace, but it made me a stronger person both physically and mentally. Kids would knock on my brace like they were knocking on a door, since the outside was hard plastic. I would just laugh to deal with the fact that I was ‘different.’ I was not less than because I had to wear this clunky contraption. These experiences also brought me closer to having strong beliefs about self-acceptance.
You cannot just let life pass you by, you must present and aware. You need to take the bull by the horns, literally! Today I work out and stretch most days, knowing it is necessary to be healthy. I also have noticed the powerful effects of yoga, and being a runner have mixed it into my work out routine which is mostly cardio. Working with what you got is more important than trying to fight it. Physical therapist after physical therapist has told me stretching is important to reduce any physical pain, so that is what I do. I run and then I stretch. I stretch and then I run. I used to get really sad about having scoliosis, but it has made me more determined. Wearing my back brace and having scoliosis has made me believe in the power of resilience. It will always get better when you strive to achieve your goal, despite any setbacks in your way.

There hasn’t been a single day in my 18-year-old life where I haven’t been worried about one thing or another. I know, it sounds somewhat strange, but truth be told, I worry about school, family, relationships, friends, money, the amount of gas in my Jeep, what I’m going to wear, what I’m going to have for dinner; the list goes on and on. It used to be my personal belief that I had to strive for perfection in every sense, shape, and form. Sometimes I used to even annoy myself with the mundane thoughts that crossed my head, and although I don’t remember, I’d be willing to bet that I came out of the womb worried about what was going to happen. A personal value that I’ve attempted to maintain (yet always struggled with my entire life) is “not caring what other people think of me”. This has always been my biggest complication – constantly questioning how others perceive me.
In retrospect however, because I’ve been this way my entire life, it has singlehandedly shaped the way I act, talk, look, and overall, just live on a day-to-day basis. I’m a relatively shy, quiet, and reserved student, but it wasn’t until fairly recently that I took a step back, looked at myself in the mirror, and truly realized that I needed to stop worrying about the things that didn’t matter. “Oh, no! I got a stain on my shirt”; My old self would have worried throughout the entire day about how people would perceive that I was messy, or how I didn’t care for personal hygiene, etc. Now? I couldn’t care less. “Yeah, I have a stain on my shirt, it doesn’t really matter” I try not to let the small things bother me anymore, and overall, I like to believe that I live by this personal code now. The small, mundane, obsolete things that used to cause so much ruckus in my life no longer matter. Now, don’t get me wrong; I don’t want to come across as someone who doesn’t care about anything at all – that isn’t the case. I still highly value my education, the grades that I work for, the health and well-being of those around me, and the things that deserve worrying, but I don’t let the things that don’t really matter affect me as much as I used to.
One of the greatest illustrations of this occurred in my first month of high school. I still remember clear as day the moment I was presenting my 9th grade science fair project to my brand-new biology honors class; it was a sea of new faces. I was concerned beyond belief on how the other students were going to perceive me, and the research I had garnered. It was finally my turn to present my project - my heart was beating, my hands were sweaty, and in the end, I quivered my way through the entire 5-minute presentation. Even my teacher, Mr. Mather, told me to relax and to do some breathing exercises. Now let’s fast-forward to Senior year – I’m giving a speech to a room of 30+ at the Warwick Public Library. I outperformed even by my own standards - so much so that I was in the local newspaper for my presentation. 
What I’m really trying to get at here is that just by changing my attitude on the way I saw others; it changed the way they saw me too. More importantly, by not allowing myself to be so concerned with how others perceived myself and my actions, I came off as confident, knowledgeable, and optimistic. I changed my personal belief from “worry about everything possible” to “stop worrying about things that don’t matter, and stop caring what people think of you”, and so much so that it holds true to this very day.","100000020"

What a person believes stems from the people you meet in life, even though you live or grow up with certain people, anyone can make an impact on you.
I personally believe that if you devote yourself to something you should stick with it and never give up until you accomplish your goal. I don’t believe in being scared of anyone or anything. I’m not scared of people because I’m a person too, anything someone does to me I have the ability to do right back to them. I’m not scared of anything because if I do happen to be scared of something, I try to conquer my fears because I don’t like when people or things try to hold me back.
I believe there is no point in growing up and living your life if you’re not living it the way you want to, or if you’re not doing something you love to do. I myself hope that one day that I don’t die from old age, but I die from doing something I was made to be a part of. 
I believe in having a role model. That one special person in your life that you only meet once. You can meet them any time whether you’re 7 years old or 77. But when you are lucky enough to find them, they change your life forever and you never forget about them no matter where you or that person ends up. I’d like to tell you a little about my role model. His name is Shane Pelton. 
I met Shane when I was 15 years old.  He was my swim coach, a little background where it all started was when I came to high school, I didn’t know a single person so my mom made me join the swim team. After the high school season was over, I joined my high school coaches’ club team and that is where I met Shane. 
Now Shane taught me everything I know. He taught me to never give up on anything. And to always follow my dreams. He told me to never apologize if I make a mistake like missing a interval or not swimming fast enough because there’s nothing to be sorry about as long as I tried. He made sure to always encourage me when I messed up and to never let anyone tell me what to do or walk all over me. 
Shane changed my life and I will always go by this motto that he told me, “work your strengths and survive your weaknesses.” I always looked up to Shane, he also was trying to find himself and as much as he loved watching me accomplish things in life, I loved watching him, Shane became a assistant swim coach at Arizona State university and now he is currently a coach at University of Southern California. He is my proof that he wasn’t just telling me to follow my dreams because he was living his so he inspired me to live mine.

My belief is to not judge others on appearances. Many people “judge a book by its cover”, but it is important in life not to do that. Growing up, during school and out of school, I was taught to not judge someone by the way they look. Someone may look a certain way but their personality is what really matters.
When I went on a mission trip with my church, we went to Lynn, Massachusetts. The town had a high poverty rate. The locals were very welcoming and had a positive attitude. When people see homeless people, they may walk away but many do not take the time to get to know their story. I volunteered at a soup kitchen during the trip, and had to sit with the guests and have conversations. I thought they would not want to converse much, but many wanted to share their stories. This is not something I would have normally done and I am glad for such a wonderful experience. 
Entering college has also taught me not to judge someone on appearances. Every day is a new opportunity to meet new people and that can only happen if you have an open mind. You never know who may end up becoming your closest friends. There may be many people who judge based on looks, and they are close minded because that is not what is really important. I have made friends with who I never thought I could approach. Taking the first step and introducing yourself is key to letting people know who you really are.

A common phrase that I take to heart and have a very strong belief about is hard work will get you farther than natural talent. The point in time when it really came full scale was my junior year at the Massachusetts Division 1 meet. Two of my teammates from my town and I were entered in the pentathlon which was half of a decathlon. I was very nervous going into the meet already but having two kids who were the definition of not practicing hard but performing well in meets made me even more nervous because I didn’t want to get last out of the kids in my town. These kids didn’t have a good work ethic. I knew if i were to do well, I knew that I would have to work extra hard because I am in no way shape or form a natural athlete. One kid was more a thrower and hurdler while the other was a jumper and a hurdler so I was not better than either of them in anything except the mile. I knew from the beginning of the year that I would be doing this and I also knew that they would probably be doing it to so I would try and keep up with them. During the entire season when they started slacking and not finishing practice hard, I would step up and finish harder than them because I knew the only way I would have a chance to beat them in anything would be to train harder than them so when it came time to perform, my hard work would out perform their natural talent. That was basically my whole motivation throughout the entire season was to out work better athletes than I. Once championship season came around, I had improved by a substantial amount since the beginning of the year while the other two have just been consistent throughout the year with no improvement. Their natural ability allowed them to beat me in the first event but for the rest of the competition was all me. I beat both of them in the rest of the events and set personal bests in most of the events. I ended up beating both of them and placed in the meet which was not bad considering I was supposed to come in last out of all of the competitors while my teammates were supposed to get top eight. They didn’t end up placing at all while I had an amazing time and it ended up affecting me i the future. Once my senior year came by, I was the top dog but that doesn’t mean I could slack off or else I’ll end up not improving so throughout my senior season, I kept last season on my mind to motivate me that no one can beat on raw talent, only on hard work. I was going to work even harder in order to make it to the All State meet and by the time I had graduated, I got fourth in Massachusetts. I was finally satisfied with myself because I never made bad habits regardless of where I was seeded: I only cared about where I ended up. My belief of hard work beats raw talent has been true because of the improvement I’ve made through hard work and to beat lazier people who was born with the talent that they had.

If you were to talk to my close friends, they would tell you I am “ridiculously optimistic”.  I am not naïve; I’m aware there are heartbreaking things that occur in everyone’s lives on a daily basis. These events are devastating and difficult; however, I believe that in spite of these occurrences it is necessary to be optimistic. If I made this statement five years ago it would be ridiculous because until nothing truly devastating had ever occurred in my life.  Since 1998, I have lived in the same house in quiet suburbia with happily married parents, a summer home at the Jersey Shore and a great group of friends.  I am by no means bragging, because my life wasn’t perfect but it was easy until I had to grow up very suddenly.  
In 2012, my father received a call saying his older brother Al, had been involved in a car accident. While the entire family was alarmed, we believed that my Uncle Al had just injured his wrist. However, one week later he was still in the hospital because after the doctors began to slowly wean him off of the painkillers it became clear that something was very wrong. Years before this incident occurred Uncle Al had been diagnosed with Multiple Scoliosis (MS) so he always needed to be on medication. In 2011, my Uncle’s wife died of cancer and unbeknownst to us, he stopped taking his medicine. In addition, he began to abuse alcohol, which is not supposed to be consumed at all when you have MS. My Uncle was an amazing person and my favorite uncle; however, he made some poor and unjustifiable decisions in an attempt to cope with the loss of my aunt. The culmination of these choices left him in the hospital a week before Christmas barely able to communicate. After this, many things changed in my life. Uncle Al’s daughter, Megan, who was in college moved in with my family, my dad had to handle all of the medical and financial bills that my uncle had accumulated, and my mother went with my uncle almost every day to physical and occupational therapy. With these changes, suddenly mealtime conversations always dealt with my uncle, the longtime tradition of “football Sundays” disappeared, and I had to become a lot more independent.
In the months following this incident I was not that optimistic person that I had been for most of my life. I briefly went through the phase where I was “mad at the world” because I couldn’t handle all of the changes suddenly thrown my way and I was just waiting for the next negative thing to happen. Finally, I reached the understanding that I could go through life waiting for more bad things or I could enjoy every day. I know that there are inevitable negatives that occur in life; but I also know that if I dwell on these events I will be missing out of the happy aspects of everyday life. My Uncle will never get better and that is a burden that I will hold with me forever. However, from that I also see the small positives that occurred such as my extended family becoming closer than ever before and my cousin now studying to be an Occupational Therapist after observing the work they did with my uncle. Each day has ups and downs but I focus on the ups and because of this, when I look back on my life in sixty years there will be more happy memories. ","100000025"

Welcome to my world. I am xxxxx and today I will take you on a journey through my life. Well, I live life adventurously! I believe life is meant to be explored, and researched and to figure out all the intangible what ifs of the world. Anything that piques my curiosity, I research, and I research allot. I have been and explored many places. One of my favorites was Hawaii. Hawaii is a beautiful and magical place; unlike any place I have ever been on earth. I had noticed the people who live there are very friendly, just don't go intruding on their surf, or their side of the island, they can be hostile if provoked. But as we journey through my life, I will also take you to Alaska. I enjoyed Alaska a lot! It’s one of the greenest places I have ever been. There are trees everywhere, the pine trees are very tall. When I was there, I went fishing for salmon. I saw a pretty big brown bear fishing by the river, as were all the fisherman fishing for salmon. I asked one of the fishermen what if the bear attacks. He said it’s no problem, and then he showed me his rifle in his backpack, and most of the fisherman there had rifles too, in case of a bear attack. That day I caught a salmon and it was 25 lbs., and the biggest fresh water fish I ever caught. That river flowed out to the sea, and the salmon swim from the sea to rivers to spawn. Wow that was an amazing day for me. Now I will take you on a trip Professor to California, I have been there many times, and I can’t seem to stay away for too long, since I really enjoy the hot dry heat in California. While there I have been to Disneyland and Knots berry farm, and had a lot of fun. Next, I will take you t North Dakota, where I worked in the oil fields. It was an interesting place in the Summer, but in the Winter, it was much different. People think it’s cold here in RI in the winter, it doesn't get 60 below 0 like it does in North Dakota! It gets so cold it barely even snows, most times every morning you wake up with a dead battery, engine that won’t start, and ice on your windshield and inside your vehicle on the glass. Also, the roads are all black ice and very slippery and dangerous. So, RI people really have no idea what cold is. I hope by now Professor, you are getting a glimpse of my life and how I have lived it, and how I see the world through my eyes. As we travel next to Florida, where I have been quite a few times. We can see that down there its very humid and hot. So, the combination leaves you sweaty all the time from the high humidity in the air. I don't really care for that state, but because family lives down there, I visit from time. Growing up in RI, I used to live in the country, and I would go fishing almost every day as a child. Once I started, I was hooked from the very first day of fishing. I just really enjoyed that past time. An if I could I would really enjoy making a living out of fishing. But I prefer fly fishing than really anything else. Currently I am in an Aquaculture major, but I am only doing it so it can get me closer to working with my favorite species of fish, which are trout. But, from me traveling and working in remote locations of the US, I have experienced more than my fair share of surprises in my life.

From the very moment you are born your family influences your core values. As a child you understand ideas and beliefs from the environment around you. Beliefs are taught through life lessons as you become older. Personally, my family that taught me the morals I stand by with to this day. I was born into a religious family. Being Italian stereotypically meant that you were religious. Up until it was too dangerous to have them operate a car, my grandparents usually never missed a Sunday mass. Being Catholic was never forced upon me, I chose to complete the Catholic Sacraments. I attended church with my family not because my parents woke me up at nine in the morning and said I have to go. In addition to attending church, I went to Sunday school up until I was a junior in high school. I made my Confirmation as a junior in high school and I am now admitted as a full member of the Roman Catholic Church. This is a story of how I began my catholic journey.
When I was in first grade, I had to start attending CCD class. At first, I was annoyed at the fact that I had to attend this class every Sunday but once I started going, I quickly realized just how important this class was for me and for my religion. In this class I had learned about the religious figures in the bible, as well as all of the stories, and how to be a good Roman Catholic. I was excited to hear that in just one short year I would be receiving my First Communion. This was the second sacrament in the Catholic Church, with the first being my Baptism. My First Communion was much more important for me because I was aware of what I was doing and was excited that finally I would be able to taste the Eucharist, which in the church is known as “Jesus’ body”. In May of second grade, I received my First Communion. Something I distinctly remember my CCD teacher telling me was that as we receive Christ’s Body and Blood, we also are nourished spiritually and brought closer to God. I remember every time I attend church and receive the Eucharist.
A few of my friends decided that they did not want to continue attending Mass and Sunday School. For me, I had planned on making my Confirmation. When making this, you are making a promise to both yourself and God that you will remain Catholic, attend Church, and follow through with the Sacraments by getting married in the Church. This was my choice, not my parents. Sunday school was getting a lot more serious and by now we knew a lot about the Bible. Coming up to our confirmation, I picked a Confirmation name and learned a lot about the Saint. My name was Saint Francis. This name was important to me and my family as I had an uncle named Francis. I remember my Confirmation day very vividly; we had a big celebration at my house and I immediately felt closer to God. I now do not have to attend Sunday school and am not forced to go to church by my parents, it is my choice. I find comfort in going to church and knowing that God is always there for me. Being in college now, whenever I am stressed, I know that I can pray to God and I will feel comfort and to easy my situation.
As I continue to attend Church, the next Sacrament I plan on making is marriage. By making my Confirmation, I made a promise to myself and God that I will get married in a Catholic Church. Although I am in no rush to get married, I plan on finishing my education first, it would be important not only for me but also my family that I get married to a Catholic woman. I plan on always keeping religion a main priority in my life and find comfort in knowing that faith will always be with me.

It is fair to say that the water is my second home. I have been swimming since I was twenty-seven months old. Competitive swimming has allowed me to meet my biggest role model and learn what I consider to be life’s most important lesson.
On my club team, the Penguins Swim Team for the Boys and Girls Club of Cumberland-Lincoln, I had a special training coach for out-of-water workouts to help us build muscle, named David. David had pushed the team to do our best even when we thought we could not continue or even complete the exercise. David has taught me the most important life lesson I will ever need. 
David is not the type of person who lets you give up, he pushes you to not only do what you need to do, but also to go the extra mile. During the training, many of us, including myself, often said “I can’t”. Whenever we said this, David would tell us to do the exercise and stop complaining. In the moment, it seemed harsh, but after hearing it repeatedly, I began to realize the impact of saying “I can’t” on my performance as not only an athlete, but also in my daily life. Saying “I can’t” hindered me from completing any task. The way David treated “I can’t” taught me that when I say it, I will not be able to complete the task. If I say I cannot, then I will not. It is a subconscious way of putting aside something that may seem difficult. When we put something aside, we lose the opportunity to get better, succeed, and be proud of ourselves. Saying “I can’t” eliminates the possibility of ever achieving a goal. 
The realization of saying “I can” has taught me many things. Believing in “I can” has allowed me to do my best and truly respect myself as a person. Learning to believe in myself and believing that I truly can do anything has allowed me to achieve some of my greatest accomplishments in and out of the water. David is my biggest role model because of the life lesson he has taught me and I will forever respect him for it. If not for the constant disapproval of “I can’t”, I do not think I would have achieved as many goals as I have. Over the years I have set many goals including becoming a better swimmer, making the honor roll every year, and becoming a lifeguard. Through the mindset of “I can” I was able to do the best I have ever done in swimming two years ago at Divisions and States. I had dropped about thirty seconds in my best event and I had helped my team to win Divisions because of this. In school, when the classwork and homework I was receiving became increasingly more difficult, I told myself that I can handle it and I have been able to make the honor roll every year because of my mindset. I never thought that I could become a lifeguard because I knew that the classes would be difficult. Telling myself that I could do it helped me to pass the class and get a job as a lifeguard. All of these accomplishments were achieved because of the “I can” mindset David had instilled in me. 
Training with David has given me the confidence, perseverance, desire, and ability to achieve anything. This belief is something that I consider a part of me, my success and is one of my greatest beliefs. Learning to say “I can” is a belief that I would not be the same without.

I used to hate running. I dreaded the fall and spring seasons through my middle school experience as there was the fitness test. The fitness test consisted of if we could touch our toes, how many sit-ups and push-ups we could do, and how fast we could run 1 mile around a beat
up soccer field. It was awful. The only sport I played through middle school was soccer, and that’s saying a lot considering I was afraid of the soccer ball. Little did I know that I would begin high school and join the indoor track team that winter. I went from being out of shape and avoiding going for a run, to actually wanting to run. But it didn’t happen overnight
I started my high school athletic experience completely out of shape. Bad idea. To make a long story short, I slowly stopped going to practice because I deemed myself not good enough or fast enough. As winter faded, and spring arrived, I decided to try one more time and go out
for the outdoor track team. There were no cuts, and I was safe. I was still awful. I hurdled and sprinted, and tried so hard and failed even harder. Since my freshman year, I only had one goal for track; to make it to the Class MM State Meet. Everyone gave me hope, but I just wasn’t improving the way I wanted to. The seasons continued to come and go, and all of a sudden, I was already in my final season of cross country my senior year. I had only done cross country for 3 years compared to 4 for track, and distance was for sure a struggle. Something just happened my senior year. We had a race every Tuesday afternoon, and each week, I beat my
5k all the way through November.
After that first season of Indoor Track my freshman year, I didn’t want to go back, but I wanted to make states this year, and I knew I had to be in shape for spring and to be ready I had to force myself to do Indoor Track. My coach was super supportive and helped me get to where I wanted. The last chance meet came around, and I just qualified for the state meet for Indoor Track. My first goal was complete. And although I didn’t do too well at states, I had still made it, and no one could take it away. I went into my final track season in shape, and with my head up. The first meet came around, and Coach Swift told us “don’t qualify for states in your first meet; you have all season to improve”. Little would I have thought that I would’ve won that race and qualified for states! I had a phenomenal season running 100m Hurdles, and the 300m Hurdles and even the 200m dash sometimes.
Looking back on it now, I still can’t believe the improvements that came to be. And now I’m in college, on a Division 1 Rowing Team, training for my second half marathon. And to think it all started with this one goal to improve and make it to a state meet for track. My freshman year of high school, I would’ve never expected the athletic endeavors I accomplished just by improving, and now I’m continuing to improve even more than I ever thought I could have. It helps me realize how much I am actually capable of, and gives me so much more confidence not only my endeavors as a growing athlete, but as a person who will soon be in the world on my own in just a couple of years.","

I believe that hard work and dedication pays off. All my life I have never been part of the team and I was a mediocre student in middle school and early high school. Once I hit junior and senior year, I decided I wanted to prove to myself I could do better in sports and in school. Pushing myself taught me I can go above and beyond what I thought I was capable of. If you are willing to push yourself then you will do better. 

I started hitting the books more in my free time. This opened up my eyes. I found out I actually loved reading which I used to hate as a kid. I also found out that I am a procrastinator. In high school I started to mess with my scheduling on my agenda when it came to projects and test. I would bump things up so I could be prepared instead of waiting till the night before. I got my grades to all As and Bs and finished out high school with a bang. 

In high school I never really was on a team, I came to college and wanted to get back into rowing and continue rowing. I had been rowing for a year but it was just at a club and I never raced. I got way more into it over summer and this year in college. When I train harder, I get better. For example. When I first started rowing my split times (how long it takes you to row 500 meters) for erging were 2:45(this means It takes me two minutes and forty-five seconds to complete a 500 meter piece) today I had a 5k erg assessment and I got a 2:13.5. (2 minutes and 13 seconds to complete a 500 meter piece) I have worked my butt off to get down to that and hopefully the next time I row a 5k I will get a lower score. 

Working hard has a remarkable payoff. If you work for something, you will do well. There is no way around this, but If you do not work hard, you won't like your results. I pushed myself harder senior year than I ever did in school. I'm going to start using these techniques again so I can get my grades higher. I need to keep my grades up in order to row and I know that if I work hard and set aside time to actually get stuff done and to work, then I will be able to score higher. This is a motto I live by because of the outcomes I have witnessed when doing my work to the full potential I can do it.

Core values is a set of principles that shape a person to become who he is today; and it is uncommon for belief to shape itself in the eyes of the observer as incidents unfold themselves right in front of your eyes. Growing up in Lebanon, where you are more likely going to be at the wrong place in the wrong time than finding yourself in a productive situation; there has been events which rewired the way I stand when it comes to other beings. Our family got invited to dinner at a river between valleys and the people there did not seem aware of their own existence and we arrived to the scene of a dog under 10 feet drop tied to tree and young kids are throwing large(for their age) rocks at the dog triggering it to wrap against a bed frame helplessly as dirt kicks up from the rocks impact. This confrontation has shaped my core values into believing that maybe were not the wisest specie after all, maybe were just the ignorant ones. Even though it was kids doing it, the normality of the situation made me realize that if nothing is done about the moment then my energy seized to exist at that specific moment. When stuff like that happens, you can only think of what is going to happen after you leave; after the scene that I caused there including a reaction I wasn't expecting took place, the owner of the restaurant brought the dog to our side of the river and that's when you realize the story for this dog will never end. Even though the dog was getting optimal treatment, I couldn't look at it in presence knowing that once I leave the same thing will happen and no one will acknowledge this act as something pessimistic. This day not only changed my views against humanity ignorance as a whole, but also elevated my belief by understanding that people don't always do the right thing because of the atmosphere. Which gives ignorance more power because he who is ignorant and is not aware then it is a double ignorance and that’s possibly the worst thing a human being can ever become through social conditioning.","100000030"

I wholeheartedly believe in the power of karma; you get back what you put out into the world. I have never been necessarily religious but there defiantly is the higher power I believe that governs all things. Yet, I remain a huge supporter of science above all theory, stories, and myths. I believe that science in the answer, yet science cannot answer all.
Growing up I was never very religious and I use to be ashamed of this. I lived in a small town where everyone was catholic and every Sunday all the kids had to go to CCD. People teased me about never seeing me there and even during middle school and high school there was a
rumor spread that I was Jewish. This never bothered me of course it was more of a joke that I embarrassed and got a laugh out of when people came up to me on Rosh Hashanah asking what the holiday actually was. When I was little, we were the type of family to just go to church on holidays like Christmas and easter, you know the important ones. We never really went regularly because my mother didn’t like the church. She was denied the right to be married in one because my father was not of the same religion and she became really upset when the catholic church covered up all the priests molesting children. Throughout the years her confidence in this organization only diminished. We even switched churches and religions jumping around to a whole bunch of beliefs. I kind of adopted this sense from my mother that no one belief was absolute and that they all should kind of be intertwined to give us a broader understanding of the world around us. Also, from a young age I never liked the tales and stories from the bible. I took the words the church said very literally and that turned me off greatly from the idea of group worship. I believed rather in science to explain forces much larger than me.
Over the years through my own experience and growth I do believe in a higher power larger than anything we can conceptualize because the truth is science can’t explain everything. I have the same sort of beliefs as early philosophers like Plato and Aristotle, I believe that we get what we give. I believe that humanity has boundaries and that overstepping those boundaries leads to punishment whatever form that comes in. Not in the sense that society will get you by their laws but something far greater than that. Just like when you start eating well and putting good things in your body you are rewarded by good long-lasting health and energy. The universe works the same way the quality you put out into the world is the same quality you will get back.
Recently, I went to a diversity week class and saw this first hand. We did an activity where first you thought of an individual that degrades you and next you pictured looking into the eyes of a person you loved. The mirror neurons people exerted were fantastic. There was a clear shift in energy and in attitude and this affected every person in the room. We looked at how individuals even their smallest actions have a profound effect on the world and the people around them.","

I believe in following my dreams no matter what the journey has ahead of me. To have a dream or goal is a beautiful thing. Having a goal really does give your life, and without one what will we be doing? My goal in this moment of my life right now is to find my meaning in life. A difficult goal it is, but I know that I will eventually choose my major and choice of career field. So far, I have been very thankful for all that my family has provided for me to get me here. My life before college was a hurricane but now it has calmed.
I have always been the responsible one. Growing up fast was not just a struggle, but a teacher full of many lessons. Having my family live from paycheck to paycheck was a constant reminder that I could not take anything for granted. I was responsible for watching over my younger sister after school and helping her get ready in each morning. Not only was this a difficult lifestyle, but I never knew that growing up rather quickly would affect me in so many ways. Being raised in a difficult environment was no burden, but rather a challenge to become the person who I am today. I am thankful to say that I am independent, empathetic, and
self-driven.
There is a saying that says “The same boiling water that hardens the egg, softens the potato. It’s not about the circumstance, but what you’re made of.” I grew up quickly when I was obligated to become the one who was relied on. I became independent from learning to not rely
on others. An example is when I took the initiative to make sure I graduate high school and to apply to college. My focus that pushed me to go farther in life was to pursue a greater outcome. That outcome which is to make a better future for myself and for the ones around me.
In addition to becoming independent, I have learned an important lesson. I can gladly say that I hold no grudges against those who have done harm. Despite my mother dealing with her own issues and leaving us kids at times, I have learned to forgive and move on. Also, I’ve
learned to empathize with people who are going through a rough time. I can see that everyone has their own struggles, and it is not forever-lasting.
Having to take on the early responsibilities of cooking, caring for my younger sister, caring for my ill grandmother, and having the adult figure in the household has been motivation. Little did I know that I would be self-driven and that I was building discipline all this time. I not only feel responsible for my own future, but empowered to create a better environment for those to come after me. I accept the challenge to chase my dreams in spite of the obstacles that come and I will continue to use circumstances to only better myself during my years at the University of Rhode Island. I believe in following my dreams.","100000032"

I, like many other people in this world, have very similar or different beliefs. Like the belief that a lot of school work can be very difficult, pertains to students. Coming off from that tangent, it does lead me to reveal one of my biggest beliefs; That the events that happen in a person’s life does affect how their future is going to hold. Similar to saying “everything happens for a reason”. Yes, this may be cliche and many people have talked about this but I do truly believe that something out there is making certain events occur which can greatly affect a person. I am not an avid religion practice so I think many things happen through coincidence but I always wonder ‘if I didn’t do this at a certain time I may not be here’. This all sounds very abstract but I think my story will better reveal my thoughts.
This story is nerdy and a little odd but it has affected my life significantly. A few years back I played on the Xbox 360. I started playing because of my brother when I was much younger and once, he moved on to college, I took it over. I would play the usual shoot them up and sport games. It was the summer going into my junior year and I had been playing on it more frequently since I had no school. This was also the time when I was beginning to think about colleges. One evening I was playing a game called “Call of Duty”-- this is one of the shooter games. I was playing online, which means I was playing with or against actual people from all over the United State. While playing online some people use headsets or a microphone so they can talk to one another. I don’t usually talk online but that evening I wanted to. As I was waiting for the game to begin, I was in an open lobby where anybody within that game can hear someone speak. I heard a girl’s voice, which is not common, so I said hey back. We started talking and eventually we became online friends; We would chat and play together. I learned that she was my age and was also looking for colleges. She told me that she was looking at the University of Rhode Island because of the Pharmacy program. I thought it was interesting, I had never thought about URI but I told her that it must be a great choice if it is known for that. As junior year went by I only heard about URI once more from another person and from the original girl, with more information. I had been applying more south because of where the colleges were geographically but I looked into URI spontaneously one day because my friend, from Xbox, had kept talking about it. I learned that they had a well-known marine biology program and I actually knew a few people who went for that program. On the day before the application was due, I decided, ‘why not? It’s on common app. So, the process won’t be too difficult and I would just have to pay the rush fees for my ACT score’. I applied, got in, and when I visited, I fell in love with it and I am very happy with the decision I made. All I can say is that I am very happy that I was able to meet this girl because she basically opened up this opportunity for me. I think, 'wow if I never had a mic in that may never have happened'.","

On the first day of my freshman year of high school, I had no idea what I wanted to do with my future. I was unsure of any interests in specific subjects, and I did not have a clear picture of what my life would be like in four years. As time passed, I developed a love for the sciences and became strong in math. I did not have a picture of what I wanted to do with my life when my high school career was over, but I was getting an idea of who I wanted to be. My future was a puzzle, and I had pieces that I could not quite put together. Around the time of the end of my sophomore year, my basketball career was beginning to surface. Coaches and colleges called me, inviting me to visit and join their programs. This helped me figure out a major part of my life because from that moment on, I knew that I was going to be a college basketball player. After countless phone calls and many visits, I committed to the University of Rhode Island at the start of my junior year. Academically, I did very well throughout the rest of the year. My basketball season was excellent where I won multiple awards and made all-county. Everything was set for me to have an amazing senior year both athletically and academically, but I got hurt. My injury took away all three sports that I was going to play for my last year of high school. The four-year goal of becoming a part of the womenÕs basketball hall of fame, which I was incredibly close to reaching, instantly became impossible to complete. Worst of all, there was a chance that I might not have been able to play college basketball. This was the moment when, without knowing it, a belief that would apply to every aspect of my life was formed. Everything happens for a reason. It took many months, but I realized that there was good in things that might have appeared bad. Despite the devastation of not being able to play, I gained an entire community of friends associated with physical therapy and rehab. Those were my first two realizations that emphasized the fact that everything happens for a reason. Getting injured connected me to multiple people who care about my life, and it exposed me to a field that I knew that I wanted to be a part of when I was older. Every day, my belief was tested to a far extent when I became isolated from my team because I physically could not do the things that they did. This is when I gained another reason why everything happens for a reason. I was not going to accept not being able to participate with my team. My injury made me develop a mindset where I learned how to overcome problems that were thrown at my life. To this day, I donÕt look at my injury as being something impossible that I had to fix, but a problem that forced me to create solutions.

I believe you must be resilient in the face of adversity. When I was eight years old I got diagnosed with scoliosis. This condition is believed to be hereditary, since my dadÕs father also has this same condition. Scoliosis is when your vertebrae arenÕt straight and curve to form a ÔCÕ or an ÔSÕ shape. I had the ÔSÕ shape, and it was actually pretty severe. They measured the actual degrees of the two curves that formed the ÔSÕ of my vertebrae. I was a tough little kid, because at the end of my second grade year I was told I would need to wear a back brace for 18 hours a day, seven days a week. For four years straight I wore the brace for 18 hours a day, meaning I slept in that thing, went to school with it on, and played with my friends at recess with it on. When I got into middle school, I was ashamed of my brace since it showed through my clothes and restricted my movement. I only wore it at night during these two years, still continuing my treatment, up until eighth grade when I was told I no longer needed the brace. 
I continued to play sports throughout the six years I wore the brace, taking it off only for soccer practice, dance lessons, skating lessons, and gym class. I can say that sticking with the regimen my orthopedic doctor explained to me really paid off. I learned that no matter what you canÕt give up on yourself. Uncomfortable isnÕt even a good enough word to describe the back brace, but it made me a stronger person both physically and mentally. Kids would knock on my brace like they were knocking on a door, since the outside was hard plastic. I would just laugh to deal with the fact that I was Ôdifferent.Õ I was not less than because I had to wear this clunky contraption. These experiences also brought me closer to having strong beliefs about self-acceptance.
You cannot just let life pass you by, you must present and aware. You need to take the bull by the horns, literally! Today I work out and stretch most days, knowing it is necessary to be healthy. I also have noticed the powerful effects of yoga, and being a runner have mixed it into my work out routine which is mostly cardio. Working with what you got is more important than trying to fight it. Physical therapist after physical therapist has told me stretching is important to reduce any physical pain, so that is what I do. I run and then I stretch. I stretch and then I run. I used to get really sad about having scoliosis, but it has made me more determined. Wearing my back brace and having scoliosis has made me believe in the power of resilience. It will always get better when you strive to achieve your goal, despite any setbacks in your way.

I started this essay an hour ago, with the topic of believing in love. After some time, I resulted in scripted lines of what the emotion does to the body and some experiences from my past which made me think the way I knew I should. But I couldnÕt seem to spill out to the right words of what truly made me believe being in love was undeniably real. So the next thing that comes to mind, after love (for me) is heartbreak. After this love that can form into a relationship, you either continue together for the rest of your lives, or break up-a scary thought. So I believe in heartbreak, which I can explain better in 500 words than I could love. 
For me, heartbreak was the most significant destruction of feelings. When thinking about it, it still strikes a nerve, even years later. How could the same person who expressed their love to me every day not want me anymore? The space between my fingers no longer held my lovers hand, but filled with pregnant air instead. Weeks after the break up, I still felt I was getting nowhere with this recovery. IÕd lay, curled up in a ball in my room, crying to ElvisÕ ÒCanÕt Help Falling in LoveÓ, wondering why it seemed so simple in the song to stay in love. Of course there were legitimate reasons to break up, but not seeing him anymore, stopping abruptly? The one person continuously on my mind for years on end? Unreasonable-I couldnÕt do it. The fibers of something inside me were pulling apart, causing the most excruciating wound. I recall the time I squished my fingers between closing garage door panels, and the time I fell off my bike, scraping my face up enough to look like a character from Halloween-no physical pain had amounted to this emotional pain I was going through. Curling up in a ball seemed to ease the pain, making me feel whole again. Ever since the breakup, a somber wave had come over me, you would no longer catch me laughing or joking. I knew I had to stay alive to please my parents, but I was so weak, I barely was living as it was. Everything seemed to relate back to him, whether it was driving to a store or climbing a mountain. I no longer worked out because I was so feeble, I wouldnÕt have been able to carry more than 10 pounds on my back before I felt dizzy. There was nothing to take my mind off it-no family game night or going for a drink with friends could aid the gaping hole. This was, in the most literal form, heartbreak. I believe in it because I felt it, and I know I felt it deeper than most. 
Most importantly, I believe heartbreak is temporary. IÕll never forget what feelings festered in me after that experience, but I know I survived it. So I am proud to spill my weaknesses out on this paper, and counteract them with the idea that I am still here, living an incredibly carefree and joyous life. Maybe IÕm still recovering from it three years later, but I think IÕm just putting myself together even more, finding out more about myself. ÒMaybe instead of trying to find my other half, I should take time to piece myself together.Ó- Anonymous  ","100596375"

As a young girl, the one person that I have always looked up to was my great grandmother. She was a strong willed individual who told the truth, spoke with pride about her family, and told stories of her childhood over and over again. She sang old nursery tunes at the top of her lungs, talked about the time she met my great grandfather, and laughed until she couldnÕt breathe over and over again. Each and every time I listened like IÕve never heard the story and sang along like I didnÕt hear it five minutes ago because the smile on her face made it feel like the first time. As a young girl, I wasnÕt sure of what AlzheimerÕs Disease was, but as I matured, I saw the ugly truth that hid behind my beautiful grandmotherÕs timeless grin. What I was sure of though was the immense love that I had for her and how she shaped my belief of how love should be patient.
Much of my childhood was spent volunteering at the nursing home where she lived. This gave me the chance to spend every tuesday with her. Although my job was to complete activities with the residents and clean the pet room, I often escaped to the sanctuary that was my great grandmother's room on the third floor. There I would lie in her bed while she watched the news with the volume cranked to the highest setting. She would ask me what grade I was in, if I was getting good grades, what grade I was in, what instrument I played, and what grade I was in. As an oblivious young girl, I remember thinking that the reason she asked the same question so many times was because she was just making sure I wasnÕt lying. But sitting here, seven months after she left, I now realize the devastating effects AlzheimerÕs Disease can take on an individual and the ones they love. As I grew older, I stopped volunteering at the nursing home as often and began seeing my great grandmother less. This didnÕt seem to matter to her though because every time I would see her, the lights in her eyes illuminated the room and she would burst into song. Seven months ago, the light in my life dimmed and I lost that song. The last memory I have of my great grandmother was holding her hand as I sang to her one last time.
Alzheimers disease has given me the life long belief that love should be patient just as I was with my great grandmother. Without saying it, she taught me to listen to what people have to say, even if itÕs for the tenth time, love unconditionally because some people cannot help what they are going through, and to stop and appreciate life because there is so much potential in one person for it to be put to waste. Although she is no longer here physically, she is constantly guiding me through life and the advice she constantly gave plays in my head like the songs she used to sing. One piece of advice that will always go without her saying is to be patient with the ones you love.

Something that I strongly belief in is that men should not look down on women and doubt their abilities. This is something that I deal with in some way or another almost everyday, along with every other woman. I have faced this issue in many different realms, including classrooms, sports fields, physical education classes, etc. I am a strong believer that women can do everything men can do, and sometimes even better. I am not a huge feminist, but it is unfair for women to be stepped all over and doubted. 
A personal experience from my earlier years I have dealing with this happened back in sixth grade. We were playing floor hockey that week in my physical education class, and we could choose who we wanted to be on our team to play two on two. My best friend, Katie, and I were on a team together, and we happened to be in a class with a lot of boys. Every time we faced a team with all boys, they always had a look of confidence on their faces, thinking that the game would be an easy win for them. However, Katie and I were, and still are, very competitive athletes and are not fazed by anything. We started off with a bang and dominated many teams that we played. The fact that our abilities as athletes were doubted gave us the motivation to work even harder and beat the boys. The look of shock and disappointed from the boys was the best feeling, and we were very proud of ourselves. 
Not only have I been doubted as an athlete, but I have also been doubted as a student. It has happened numerous times, both in big and small ways. One of the more recent cases happened not too long ago, actually in my biology 101 lecture. We were taking a group quiz, and every time I suggested an answer, I was doubted by one of my male group mates. I felt confident in my answers, and I even had my notes out to back up my answers. Yet, my group mate would say that I am wrong, and call out to another male student a few seats down and ask what he thought the answer was. Sure enough, the answers I suggested were the same as the ones the other student said. When we found out we got the answer correct, the student that doubted me would not apologize and gave credit to the other student. This really rubbed me the wrong way, but I just decided to let the situation be and not say anything about it. 
My belief that men should not look down on women is something that, unfortunately, many women have to deal with. However, that is not to say that every man is guilty of doing so. Many men are supportive of women, and hopefully one day all men will think of women as equals.","100582489"

I believe hard work is necessary to be successful in life. Since a young age, this phrase has been engraved in my mind. With this drive to do everything to the best of my ability, my work ethic has been shaped into performing at no other level than my hardest. The main events that truly showed me how much success depends on hard work were my school selection experience as well as my rowing career. 
Growing up, I had my dadÕs whole side of the family that never got a college education. I always saw college in my future, but I was always intimidated by the fact that half of my family did not take that path. I knew that I was going to have to work extra hard to get myself noticed by schools, so I started early. I took many SAT and ACT prep courses in order to familiarize myself with the layout and types of questions the test contained. The first couple of times I took these tests, my scores were very far from where I wanted them to be, as well as far from the cutoff scores of the schools I was looking at. But I did not give up. Instead, I kept signing up for more practice tests and available tutoring sessions. Eventually, by putting the work in, I got my scores to far above what I thought possible, and it put me ahead of the majority of students applying to the same schools as I. 
Another event that really shaped my determined work ethic was by rowing all throughout high school, and continuing it now on the college team. Rowing is a sport in which mental toughness is necessary for any type of success. It is also a sport that not many can go through with doing, let alone excel in due to the intensity of the work that needs to be put in. The workouts that we do are grueling, and never fail to make you want to give up. During races you need to turn off your mind or else you will shut down from the pain. But when you put in the work, even though you may be in as much pain as you have ever been in, the reward is much greater than the misery you go through. The feeling of self-gratitude that you feel after pushing yourself to your maximum potential is one of the best feelings there is, and that is why I continue to row. This teaches you to buckle down and take the pain in order to prove yourself and show what it takes to compete at the division one level.  
As you can see, these two events have framed my thinking that hard work is necessary in order to obtain success at anything you do. Although these are only two specific events where I display the mentality of dedication to my work, I use that mindset in order to tackle any task that I am faced with. Hard work is most definitely necessary for success. ","100591433"

I am not the kind of person that does a lot of self-reflection, but if i am to say what my beliefs are, I know that I believe in tolerance, forgiveness, humility but most importantly, I believe in peace. Coming from a very war-torn country, I know to achieve this would be difficult cause humans are so different from each other even if with shared race and religion. In this school naturally the center for nonviolence and peace study interested me.I attended the Peacebuilding and Diversity in the Tamil Nadu and Nagaland State of India speech presented by Dr.Paul Bueno de Mesquita and his wife, Kay Johnson. They gave speeches about their experiences on the business/tour tip. They talked about the difference in cultures; how about 60-80% of marriages in India are arranged.They also covered disturbing facts about the country like; 70% of married women in India suffer domestic violence, 55% of all women in India faced family violence and abuse and lastly 67% child abuse in terms of sexual assaults. One of the highlights of the speech was them meeting Gandhi's great grandson. With all said, it was a really great speech, and by the end, I felt like I have gotten a deeper insight about the lifestyle in India. 
During the diversity week, for my URI 101 class, I decided to attend Professor Kimberle CrenshawÕs speech about Race, Reform and New Retrenchment. Although, she wasnÕt directly talking about peace, her speech about how equality can be achieved was really resourceful and informative; one that made me self reflect a lot.I realized that I tend to think that a problem isnÕt mine to solve since it doesnÕt affect me directly; she called it ÒThe FrameÓ; meaning if the frame (situation) was different and it visualizes the direct effect it would have on the society as a whole, everyone would react differently than if they thought it only affected a certain group of people. Throughout the night she went on to talk about blacks lives matter, affirmative action, structural racism and white privilege, color blind framing of racial inequality and even the presidential debate that happened the previous night,but the activity she engaged the audience in, before the end of her speech, is what shook me the most. She introduced her last section which was ÒIntersectional ErasureÓ, but before she elaborated, she asked all the people present to stand up. Explaining the activity, she would call out a few names and anyone who doesnÕt know the name mentioned would sit down, until the last person standing. When she began, she called out names that were really prominent in the blacks lives matter movement; names of those killed by the police; names like Michael Brown, Freddie Gray, Tamir Rice and Alton Sterling.  As she called the names, few people sat down, and I remembered looking around not believing that some people havenÕt heard of the tragedies. As she moves down the list, more and more people (including myself), sat down. Then she made her points; the latter part of the names in which everyone sat down were cases about police brutality against black women. This is what she called ÒIntersectional ErasureÓ; how an equally tragic death wasnÕt as popular and seemed to be erased (even in the movement) based on the gender of the victim. She then went ahead to show us a video called ÒSay Her NameÓ; The video contained such disturbing scenes, that it chilled the entire audience. That video was still (and till this day) vivid in my mind, hopefully the video would get more attention, and more people would be aware. I enjoyed both of the sessions I attended; I got to see India through the eyes of Mr Paul and his wife, Kay and I also gained immense knowledge that encouraged me to be more aware, through the powerful speech of Ms. KimberlŽ Williams Crenshaw.

Wait You are Telling Me Bad Things Happen?
We are all here to die, in a world where bad things happen, and the people who understand that are free. Nothing in this world is permanent, eventually IÕll die, eventually my family will die, eventually the earth will die, so why bother worrying about it? If something is bound to happen and thereÕs nothing I can do to change it, then why would I be scared of it, why would I waste my time being afraid of whatÕs inevitable? My goal is to live in the present, and to truly know what I have before I lose it again. 

In exactly one month, I will have lived for the past 10 years without my father. He was hit by a car when I was nine years old, and I never really understood what had happened that day until later in my life. My nine-year old mind couldnÕt really comprehend what ÒgoneÓ is, its just not something I could understand for what it actually was. I remember the morning that my father was taken to the hospital, I still went to school for about an hour. As I was leaving school I asked my sister how Òdad was doing?Ó and she replied with Ònot goodÓ. I laughed. I thought it was a joke. Why would something bad happen to us? I honestly couldnÕt describe to you what the following years after his death felt like, it was a blur to me, and it still is a blur to me. My childhood wouldÕve ended then and there, had it not been for my mother. 

Six years after my father's passing, my sister was run off the highway, and she flipped her car going 65mph. This was the second time in my life, up until then, that I felt my heart stop, and I was living in the moment. My sister had broken her spine, and was in the ICU for 6 months. I had slept more nights in a hospital, than days I had attended school that year. She survived*, with no head injuries, but she is paralyzed from the chest down. 
      
Two years after my sister's accident, something that is very common for people who went through a loss or tragic event as a young child happened to me. I was diagnosed with depression. What happened was that I got to a point in my life where I was actually able to understand what had happened and all the Òlost emotionsÓ basically came back to me at one time. I was half way through my sophomore year at the time, and I was unable to function. There was nothing I wanted to do, I didnÕt want to get up, I didnÕt want to eat, I didnÕt want to move. There was nothing I wanted, and to me at the time there was nothing but an emptiness. Depression is a type of sadness, but it gets to a point where itÕs easier to describe it as the absence of emotion. I was a body without a brain. The whole time I was depressed this thing happens where your brain isnÕt in control. I was basically forced to think by my own brain. I stayed awake for nights without end thinking of what happened, how, why, why, why, why. It was that same thinking that healed me, and is the basis for my beliefs. From that time I realized that hey bad shit happens, and it's happening all the time, and to anyone. Life isnÕt fair. I accepted that awful things happen, and when they do happen, I was already prepared for it. I knew it would happen again eventually, so I live in the present and make the most out of whatever happens.
My sister actually goes to URI and is doing amazingly. She is currently in her second year of her master's program for nursing, and is already flagged for her doctorates. ","100602707"

There hasn't been a single day in my 18-year old life where I haven't been worried about one thing or another. I know, it sounds somewhat strange, but truth be told, I worry about school, family, relationships, friends, money, the amount of gas in my Jeep, what I'm going to wear, what IÕm going to have for dinner; the list goes on and on. It used to be my personal belief that I had to strive for perfection in every sense, shape, and form. Sometimes I used to even annoy myself with the mundane thoughts that crossed my head, and although I don't remember, I'd be willing to bet that I came out of the womb worried about what was going to happen. A personal value that I've attempted to maintain (yet always struggled with my entire life) is not caring what other people think of me. This has always been my biggest complication Ð constantly questioning how others perceive me.
In retrospect however, because I've been this way my entire life, it has singlehandedly shaped the way I act, talk, look, and overall just live on a day-to-day basis. I'm a relatively shy, quiet, and reserved student, but it wasn't until fairly recently that I took a step back, looked at myself in the mirror, and truly realized that I needed to stop worrying about the things that didn't matter. Oh, no! I got a stain on my shirt; My old self would have worried throughout the entire day about how people would perceive that I was messy, or how I didn't care for personal hygiene, etc. Now? I couldn't care less. Yeah, I have a stain on my shirt, it doesn't really matter I try not to let the small things bother me anymore, and overall, I like to believe that I live by this personal code now. The small, mundane, obsolete things that used to cause so much ruckus in my life no longer matter. Now, donÕt get me wrong; I donÕt want to come across as someone who doesnÕt care about anything at all Ð that isnÕt the case.I still highly value my education, the grades that I work for, the health and well-being of those around me, and the things that deserve worrying, but I donÕt let the things that don't really matter affect me as much as I used to.One of the greatest illustrations of this occurred in my first month of high school. I still remember clear as day the moment I was presenting my 9th grade science fair project to my brand-new biology honors class; it was a sea of new faces. I was concerned beyond belief on how the other students were going to perceive me, and the research I had garnered. It was finally my turn to present my project - my heart was beating, my hands were sweaty, and in the end, I quivered my way through the entire 5-minute presentation. Even my teacher, Mr. Mather, told me to relax and to do some breathing exercises. Now let's fast-forward to Senior year Ð I'm giving a speech to a room of 30+ at the Warwick Public Library. I outperformed even by my own standards - so much so that I was in the local newspaper for my presentation. 
What I'm really trying to get at here is that just by changing my attitude on the way I saw others, it changed the way they saw me too. More importantly, by not allowing myself to be so concerned with how others perceived myself and my actions, I came off as confident, knowledgeable, and optimistic. I changed my personal belief from worry about everything possibleÓ to Òstop worrying about things that don't matter, and stop caring what people think of youÓ, and so much so that it holds true to this very day.","100594057"

What a person believes stems from the people you meet in life, even though you live or grow up with certain people, anyone can make an impact on you.
I personally believe that if you devote yourself to something you should stick with it and never give up until you accomplish your goal. I donÕt believe in being scared of anyone or anything. IÕm not scared of people because IÕm a person too, anything someone does to me I have the ability to do right back to them. IÕm not scared of anything because if I do happen to be scared of something I try to conquer my fears because I donÕt like when people or things try to hold me back.
I believe there is no point in growing up and living your life if youÕre not living it the way you want to, or if youÕre not doing something you love to do. I myself hope that one day that I donÕt die from old age, but I die from doing something I was made to be a part of. 
I believe in having a role model. That one special person in your life that you only meet once. You can meet them any time whether youÕre 7 years old or 77. But when you are lucky enough to find them they change your life forever and you never forget about them no matter where you or that person ends up. Id like to tell you a little about my role model. His name is Shane Pelton. 
I met Shane when I was 15 years old.  He was my swim coach, a little background where it all started was when I came to high school I didnÕt know a single person so my mom made me join the swim team. After the high school season was over I joined my high school coachesÕ club team and that is where I met Shane. 
Now Shane taught me everything I know. He taught me to never give up on anything. And to always follow my dreams. He told me to never apologize if I make a mistake like missing a interval or not swimming fast enough because thereÕs nothing to be sorry about as long as I tried. He made sure to always encourage me when I messed up and to never let anyone tell me what to do or walk all over me. 
Shane changed my life and I will always go by this motto that he told me, Òwork your strengths and survive your weaknesses.Ó I always looked up to Shane, he also was trying to find himself and as much as he loved watching me accomplish things in life I loved watching him, Shane became a assistant swim coach at Arizona State university and now he is currently a coach at University of Southern California. He is my proof that he wasnÕt just telling me to follow my dreams because he was living his so he inspired me to live mine.

On September 10th I turned 18 years old, I became an adult. With this turning of age I gained a whole new prospective for life. I am now solely responsible for myself and my actions. I no longer need to get my parents signature on papers, I can get a tattoo, and I can vote for the next president. There are a ton of things you are magically able to do on your own when you turn 18. By accepting personal responsibility, you gain the freedom to create your own life, any way you want it. I truly believe that it is your life and you should be able to live it how you want. Nobody should be able to tell you what you can or cannot do.

Growing up, you always look toward your parents for acceptance and permission. â€œDad can I go here?â€ or â€œMom can I do this?â€, that all ends when you turn 18. Sure, you still want their acceptance, but ultimately your life is in your hands. My whole life I have lived in New Jersey. Now that Iâ€™m going to college in Rhode Island, I realized I donâ€™t want to live on the east coast anymore. I have always dreamed of living in California and I have always known I would end up on the west coast, I just didnâ€™t know when. The opportunity arose quicker than I anticipated but I figured now is as good of a time as ever.

I have always been a daddyâ€™s girl. So naturally when I broke the news to my father he wasnâ€™t very pleased. The very thought of his favorite daughter being thousands of miles away was almost unbearable. It took me a while to muster up the courage to tell him my plans for next year. I explained to my dad that I really wanted to get the experience of actually living on my own. I think that you need to get real world experiences at a young age in order to be ready for what is to come after college. Even if you are not sure if it is exactly what you want, you should be able to make your own mistakes. Because eventually, you will learn from them. You learn how to take care of yourself and find out who you truly are. I think living in California will help me to discover who I am and force me to realize what I really want out of my life. 

My dad opposed the idea of me moving out to California even after I explained my reasons, but I decided that it is my life and it is my choice. In order to live my life how I want, I must do what I want. If there are people out there holding you back from living YOUR own life, you need to take a step back and ask yourself if that is the way you really want to live it. Leading a life based on other peoplesâ€™ opinions and views is not the way it should be. Once you accept responsibility for your own actions, you then gain the freedom to make your own choices. If you think itâ€™ll make you happy I say go for it. California here I come. ","100592232"

My belief is to not judge others on appearances. Many people Òjudge a book by its coverÓ, but it is important in life not to do that. Growing up, during school and out of school, I was taught to not judge someone by the way they look. Someone may look a certain way but their personality is what really matters.
When I went on a mission trip with my church, we went to Lynn, Massachusetts. The town had a high poverty rate. The locals were very welcoming and had a positive attitude. When people see homeless people, they may walk away but many do not take the time to get to know their story. I volunteered at a soup kitchen during the trip, and had to sit with the guests and have conversations. I thought they would not want to converse much, but many wanted to share their stories. This is not something I would have normally done and I am glad for such a wonderful experience. 
Entering college has also taught me not to judge someone on appearances. Every day is a new opportunity to meet new people and that can only happen if you have an open mind. You never know who may end up becoming your closest friends. There may be many people who judge based on looks, and they are close minded because that is not what is really important. I have made friends with who I never thought I could approach. Taking the first step and introducing yourself is key to letting people know who you really are.

It is fair to say that the water is my second home. I have been swimming since I was twenty-seven months old. Competitive swimming has allowed me to meet my biggest role model and learn what I consider to be lifeÕs most important lesson.On my club team, the Penguins Swim Team for the Boys and Girls Club of Cumberland-Lincoln, I had a special training coach for out-of-water workouts to help us build muscle, named David. David had pushed the team to do our best even when we thought we could not continue or even complete the exercise. David has taught me the most important life lesson I will ever need. David is not the type of person who lets you give up, he pushes you to not only do what you need to do, but also to go the extra mile. During the training, many of us, including myself, often said ÒI canÕtÓ. Whenever we said this, David would tell us to do the exercise and stop complaining. In the moment, it seemed harsh, but after hearing it repeatedly, I began to realize the impact of saying ÒI canÕtÓ on my performance as not only an athlete, but also in my daily life. Saying ÒI canÕtÓ hindered me from completing any task. The way David treated ÒI canÕtÓ taught me that when I say it, I will not be able to complete the task. If I say I cannot, then I will not. It is a subconscious way of putting aside something that may seem difficult. When we put something aside, we lose the opportunity to get better, succeed, and be proud of ourselves. Saying ÒI canÕtÓ eliminates the possibility of ever achieving a goal. 
	The realization of saying ÒI canÓ has taught me many things. Believing in ÒI canÓ has allowed me to do my best and truly respect myself as a person. Learning to believe in myself and believing that I truly can do anything has allowed me to achieve some of my greatest accomplishments in and out of the water. David is my biggest role model because of the life lesson he has taught me and I will forever respect him for it. If not for the constant disapproval of ÒI canÕtÓ, I do not think I would have achieved as many goals as I have. Over the years I have set many goals including becoming a better swimmer, making the honor roll every year, and becoming a lifeguard. Through the mindset of ÒI canÓ I was able to do the best I have ever done in swimming two years ago at Divisions and States. I had dropped about thirty seconds in my best event and I had helped my team to win Divisions because of this. In school, when the classwork and homework I was receiving became increasingly more difficult, I told myself that I can handle it and I have been able to make the honor roll every year because of my mindset. I never thought that I could become a lifeguard because I knew that the classes would be difficult. Telling myself that I could do it helped me to pass the class and get a job as a lifeguard. All of these accomplishments were achieved because of the ÒI canÓ mindset David had instilled in me. 
	Training with David has given me the confidence, perseverance, desire, and ability to achieve anything. This belief is something that I consider a part of me, my success and is one of my greatest beliefs. Learning to say ÒI canÓ is a belief that I would not be the same without.

From the very moment you are born your family influences your core values. As a child you understand ideas and beliefs from the environment around you. Beliefs are taught through life lessons as you become older. Personally, my family that taught me the morals I stand by with to this day. I was born into a religious family. Being Italian stereotypically meant that you were religious. Up until it was too dangerous to have them operate a car, my grandparents usually never missed a Sunday mass. Being Catholic was never forced upon me, I chose to complete the Catholic Sacraments. I attended church with my family not because my parents woke me up at nine in the morning and said I have to go. In addition to attending church I went to Sunday school up until I was a junior in high school. I made my Confirmation as a junior in high school and I am now admitted as a full member of the Roman Catholic Church. This is a story of how I began my catholic journey.
When I was in first grade I had to start attending CCD class. At first, I was annoyed at the fact that I had to attend this class every Sunday but once I started going I quickly realized just how important this class was for me and for my religion. In this class I had learned about the religious figures in the bible, as well as all of the stories, and how to be a good Roman Catholic. I was excited to hear that in just one short year I would be receiving my First Communion. This was the second sacrament in the Catholic Church, with the first being my Baptism. My First Communion was much more important for me because I was aware of what I was doing and was excited that finally I would be able to taste the Eucharist, which in the church is known as ÒJesusÕ bodyÓ. In May of second grade, I received my First Communion. Something I distinctly remember my CCD teacher telling me was that as we receive ChristÕs Body and Blood, we also are nourished spiritually and brought closer to God. I remember every time I attend church and receive the Eucharist.A few of my friends decided that they did not want to continue attending Mass and Sunday School. For me, I had planned on making my Confirmation. When making this, you are making a promise to both yourself and God that you will remain Catholic, attend Church, and follow through with the Sacraments by getting married in the Church. This was my choice, not my parents. Sunday school was getting a lot more serious and by now we knew a lot about the Bible. Coming up to our confirmation, I picked a Confirmation name and learned a lot about the Saint. My name was Saint Francis. This name was important to me and my family as I had an uncle named Francis. I remember my Confirmation day very vividly; we had a big celebration at my house and I immediately felt closer to God. I now do not have to attend Sunday school and am not forced to go to church by my parents, it is my choice. I find comfort in going to church and knowing that God is always there for me. Being in college now, whenever I am stressed I know that I can pray to God and I will feel comfort and to easy my situation.
As I continue to attend Church, the next Sacrament I plan on making is marriage. By making my Confirmation, I made a promise to myself and God that I will get married in a Catholic Church. Although I am in no rush to get married, I plan on finishing my education first, it would be important not only for me but also my family that I get married to a Catholic woman. I plan on always keeping religion a main priority in my life and find comfort in knowing that faith will always be with me.

Dear future freshman,
I can understand your overwhelming wave of questions and emotions you're feeling as your moving into your new home. Believe me, I've been there. Freshman year is the hardest year, because you have to adjust to the college life. However, if you heed my advice, you will hopefully have some stress of your shoulders. The first and most important thing you must consider is good time managing skills. Managing time is important for balancing school work with gym time, hanging with friends, partying, etc. This way you can get work done efficiently and have a social life at the same time. Work hard, play harder. Another key thing is to be on top of your work. Try to get work done as early as possible so you have time to do fun things. This means studying your syllabus every now and then to make sure you are up to date with work. Being behind in a class is horrible and it takes extra effort to get back on track. For your social life, donÕt be scared to be expressive and going out there to find friends. Every freshman is on the same boat and looking for new friends. I challenge you to express yourself extra even if youÕre shy like I was in the past. The final key advice I shall share with you is to have fun. College is a time of finding yourself and experiencing new fun things. I would take any opportunity thrown at you, like clubs, joining Greek life, , or free time to hang with friends. I wouldnÕt spend all my time in my dorm binge watching Netflix when I could seize the opportunity of enjoying the college experience. This is all just my future freshman, but every individual college experience is different. I advise taking the fun and serious route through college.","100579299"

If you were to talk to my close friends they would tell you I am ridiculously optimistic.  I am not naive; I'm aware there are heartbreaking things that occur in everyoneÕs lives on a daily basis. These events are devastating and difficult; however, I believe that in spite of these occurrences it is necessary to be optimistic. If I made this statement five years ago it would be ridiculous because until nothing truly devastating had ever occurred in my life.  Since 1998, I have lived in the same house in quiet suburbia with happily married parents, a summer home at the Jersey Shore and a great group of friends.  I am by no means bragging, because my life wasnÕt perfect but it was easy until I had to grow up very suddenly.  
In 2012, my father received a call saying his older brother Al, had been involved in a car accident. While the entire family was alarmed, we believed that my Uncle Al had just injured his wrist. However, one week later he was still in the hospital because after the doctors began to slowly wean him off of the painkillers it became clear that something was very wrong. Years before this incident occurred Uncle Al had been diagnosed with Multiple Scoliosis (MS) so he always needed to be on medication. In 2011, my UncleÕs wife died of cancer and unbeknownst to us, he stopped taking his medicine. In addition, he began to abuse alcohol, which is not supposed to be consumed at all when you have MS. My Uncle was an amazing person and my favorite uncle; however, he made some poor and unjustifiable decisions in an attempt to cope with the loss of my aunt. The culmination of these choices left him in the hospital a week before Christmas barely able to communicate. After this, many things changed in my life. Uncle AlÕs daughter, Megan, who was in college moved in with my family, my dad had to handle all of the medical and financial bills that my uncle had accumulated, and my mother went with my uncle almost every day to physical and occupational therapy. With these changes, suddenly mealtime conversations always dealt with my uncle, the longtime tradition of Òfootball SundaysÓ disappeared, and I had to become a lot more independent.In the months following this incident I was not that optimistic person that I had been for most of my life. I briefly went through the phase where I was Òmad at the worldÓ because I couldnÕt handle all of the changes suddenly thrown my way and I was just waiting for the next negative thing to happen. Finally, I reached the understanding that I could go through life waiting for more bad things or I could enjoy every day. I know that there are inevitable negatives that occur in life; but I also know that if I dwell on these events I will be missing out of the happy aspects of everyday life. My Uncle will never get better and that is a burden that I will hold with me forever. However, from that I also see the small positives that occurred such as my extended family becoming closer than ever before and my cousin now studying to be an Occupational Therapist after observing the work they did with my uncle. Each day has ups and downs but I focus on the ups and because of this, when I look back on my life in sixty years there will be more happy memories. ","100583532"

For future freshman entering college here is some advice that I have learned throughout my experience first semester. College gives us freedom and responsibility. Your parents are not here to make you go to class or do your work. Already you may be thinking awesome! I can skip class and be fine. Well, that is not the smart decision. Skipping class is ok if you are sick, and I mean sick as in throwing up canÕt leave your bed sick. A lot of the time if we donÕt feel good we must suck it up and go to class. Trust me in high school you could probably miss three days of school and still get AÕs, in college you can go to class and zone out for a minute and you become so confused. Going to class and staying on top of the work is super important you should always check more than once a day to see if professors have posted any assignments. If not, you could accidentally miss one. Time management is important, you should not wait to do a project, paper, or homework assignment last minute. That is how you end up staying up all night, not sleeping and then dozing off in your classes. Also, going out is big part of the college experience, but do not go overboard. Going out every weekend is bad for health and mind. Go out in moderation. I hope this helps you at least a little bit take things into account and more seriously 
P.S- freshman fifteen is real take advantage of that gym and make healthy choices. ","100595690"

Originally when I was going to write this essay, I thought it would be on happy endings. Once upon a time I used to believe in them, but as I grew older and experienced life I learned that not everyone gets a happy ending. Instead this essay is going to be about hope, hope is a powerful driving force in the world, just having hope is a powerful thing for most people. I donÕt want to make some speech, saying that my belief is more justified than another personÕs, as that is simply not true. Everyone is allowed to have their own feelings, opinions, and beliefs, and to say mine is above theirs is presumptuous of me.
Throughout our lives we will eventually hit a rough patch, though this may be cynical no one can deny it is the truth, When I was in high school my family hit a rough patch in our lives that threatened to tear us apart. My dad was discovered of being unfaithful to my mother for many years. This discovery put an intense strain on my family, my parents kept on fighting for years over this and it looked like it would stay that way. I just tried to hold onto hope in this situation, though it was hard to do form the toxic relationship that built up from the fighting. Eventually my dad moved out of the house and everything started to look better. A few years later and my parents finally divorced and can actually be civil together. The strain on my familyÕs relationship will always be there, but it gets easier to deal with in time. The relationship with my dad will never be the same as the one before his secret was discovered, but IÕm happy to still have him in my life. 
What IÕm trying to say here is that holding onto hope is the most important thing anyone can do. Many other people can identify with my situation of being in a toxic family, if I didnÕt have hope I probably would have fallen into depression. There was so much fighting going on for years, back and forth, spewing one hateful comment after another. I wasn't sure that I could handle seeing two people who I love dearly, rip each otherÕs throat out. Thankfully I had my friends to help me through this point in my life, as many of them had been through the same thing. This allowed me to escape and think, which allowed me to hope. Many people in this world do not have hope, their lives are so fundamentally different from mine, that i could never truly understand them. Hope is always the same though, it why we see change today. Just a little hope is all anyone needs in life, because believing that things will get better is sa powerful thing indeed.

I, like many other people in this world, have very similar or different beliefs. Like the belief that a lot of school work can be very difficult, pertains to students. Coming off from that tangent, it does lead me to reveal one of my biggest beliefs; That the events that happen in a personÕs life does affect how their future is going to hold. Similar to saying Òeverything happens for a reasonÓ. Yes, this may be cliche and many people have talked about this but I do truly believe that something out there is making certain events occur which can greatly affect a person. I am not an avid religion practicer so I think many things happen through coincidence but I always wonder Ôif I didnÕt do this at a certain time I may not be hereÕ. This all sounds very abstract but I think my story will better reveal my thoughts.

This story is nerdy and a little odd but it has affected my life significantly. A few years back I played on the Xbox 360. I started playing because of my brother when I was much younger and once he moved on to college, I took it over. I would play the usual shoot emÕ up and sport games. It was the summer going into my junior year and I had been playing on it more frequently since I had no school. This was also the time when I was beginning to think about colleges. One evening I was playing a game called ÒCall of DutyÓ-- this is one of the shooter games. I was playing online, which means I was playing with or against actual people from all over the United State. While playing online some people use headsets or a microphone so they can talk to one another. I donÕt usually talk online but that evening I wanted to. As I was waiting for the game to begin, I was in an open lobby where anybody within that game can hear someone speak. I heard a girlÕs voice, which is not common, so I said hey back. We started talking and eventually we became online friends; We would chat and play together. I learned that she was my age and was also looking for colleges. She told me that she was looking at the University of Rhode Island because of the Pharmacy program. I thought it was interesting, I had never thought about URI but I told her that it must be a great choice if it is known for that. As junior year went by I only heard about URI once more from another person and from the original girl, with more information. I had been applying more south because of where the colleges were geographically but I looked into URI spontaneously one day because my friend, from Xbox, had kept talking about it. I learned that they had a well-known marine biology program and I actually knew a few people who went for that program. On the day before the application was due I decided, Ôwhy not? ItÕs on common app. So the process wonÕt be too difficult and I would just have to pay the rush fees for my ACT scoreÕ. I applied, got in, and when I visited I fell in love with it and I am very happy with the decision I made. All I can say is that I am very happy that I was able to meet this girl because she basically opened up this opportunity for me. I think, 'wow if I never had a mic in that may never have happened'.","100593316"

I believe that opportunity is for those who want it. If you want something, you have to work hard for it or that opportunity will be gone. Coming from an Asian family, both my parents would constantly tell me to study and take advantage of the opportunities they never had. I remember asking them why they moved to America for a school assignment. They always spoke of the opportunities that America provides however, those opportunities did not come free. Everything up to this point in my parents' lives was because of hard work. They also know not everyone has an equal opportunity here in America. They stressed that I had to be one of the best in order for people to hire me. My parents meant that although there were all types of people in America, they knew that Caucasians would have the greatest chance at finding jobs and opportunities. If I show laziness during my studies, I may as well throw away the opportunities that my parents offered me by coming to America.
From as long as I can remember, my father has always had pains somewhere on his body. These pains were due to overexertion during work. My father has always worked at a restaurant as a chef ever since he came to America. He always came home saying, ÒOh son, look at the burns on my hands. If you don't want to work the job I have, then you must study diligently.Ó Back in China, my dad worked as a banker. He graduated from high school with good math skills and went straight to banking. He often reflects about how in China, he had to climb a hill in order to borrow a single book from the library. He marvels that it is so much easier for kids like me nowadays.
My parents came to America in order to give me a better opportunity. In school, I have learned to develop my reading, writing, and speaking skills in English. By doing this, I have become a great asset to my parents who are unable to read or speak English efficiently. I was able to read the bills, interpret important health insurance documents, and translate conversations. I have accompanied my father to so many doctor appointments over the past few years for various issues. I would interpret whatever the doctors had to say to the best of my abilities and tell my father about the conditions he had.
Working as a chef in a Chinese restaurant is a extremely hard job. My father has been working as a chef for different Chinese restaurants for as long as I can remember and therefore has strained and hurt himself many times over the years. His work ranges from cooking food while battling scorching oils to lifting cumbersome shipments of raw meat. I remember trying my best to translate the words the doctor had said. My father had a case of carpal tunnel that could prevent him from working if it wasn't taken care of. He also needed physical therapy in the lumbar region of his body. My father insisted that he should continue to work even under these circumstances because he did not have health insurance making the treatment very costly. My mother talked to him and asked him to think rationally because this all of our lives. Eventually my father agreed to take the therapy. Without the support of my father, our household would crumble, and I would have to split my focus from school into finding a job in order to support the rest of the family.
Opportunity is something not everyone has. My parents came to America in order to seek a better life for me. They want me to develop myself both in academics and as a person. Being reminded constantly to study in order to become what I want to be has driven me forward and has shaped the person I have become today. My parents' struggles and sacrifices inspire me to take advantage of the many opportunities they have given me.

As cliche as it might sound, something that I strongly believe in is Karma, itÕs a real thing. The idea of treating someone the way that you want to be treated has been beaten into our minds since we just a child in Kindergarten. If you broke little JohnnyÕs favorite toy, you could only expect that he would do the same to you, but if you shared your snacks with him at your snack time, he would probably end up sharing his too...unless hes like me, and sharing snacks isnÕt even an option. Sometimes people tend to forget this concept, and think that they can say or do whatever they want without thinking how other people would feel about it. But an event that once happened to me in high school never fails to remind me that karma, and treating people the way that YOU want to be treated is in fact a real thing.
Growing up with a mentally ill brother can be a struggle that some people just do not understand, I mean how could they if they were never exposed to it? My brother Corey is 33 years old, thatÕs 15 years older than me to save you from trying to figure out the math. He was born normal my mom says, like every teenage boy he rode bikes, played football and went to the school dances, but around 18 is when my mom noticed a change in his behavior. Corey started acting out, drinking, smoking, and doing other drugs that my mom had no idea about, and eventually he dropped out of high school, getting his GED and leaving my home. What my mom didnÕt know was why he was acting out. 
About 8 years later my brother returned home, to get help. Corey was diagnosed with severe Paranoia Schizophrenia. The doctors said this is why he was acting out, because the ÒvoicesÓ were telling him what to do, and he was trying to self medicate because he was too afraid to tell anyone. So, as you might know someone with such a serious mental illness does not always look or act like everyone else. To me my brother is just my brother, I love him and always will no matter what he is going through, but other people do not always realize that heÕs not weird or on drugs, he is sick and this happens a lot in public. An incident that really angered me was last year, Corey had gotten in a car with one of his ÒfriendsÓ and they were going to go hang out with other people, so while driving on the highway his friend was driving like a Ònut bagÓ as he would say, so he made him let him out of the car..in the middle of the highway, smart right? Well what he didnÕt know was that he was almost in Connecticut, and it was 10 at night. So, not knowing where he was he called my mom and she told him to call the police station for them to come get him because they could use his gps on his phone to find him. Well when the Policemen got there they were not professional or kind at all, they kept interrogating him trying to say that he was on drugs, and they need to arrest him for Òbeing on narcoticsÓ. Now, i only know this for a fact because he had them on speakerphone and they talked to my mom. Well the crazy lady that my mom is, was very angry and wrote a letter to their chief saying that they need training on how to deal with mentally ill people in the community, and well now they had a station wide meeting about how to deal with the mentally ill.
So, i believe that if you are going to treat someone like they are less than you then karma is going to come back and bite you in the butt. If they had treated Corey like a real person they would not of had to sit through that long class.","100576835"

work hard or be a role model, have fun, have an opinion, always expect the unexpected. These are phrases that I have come to believe are guidelines for my overall happiness and success as a person. I have played hockey for most of my life, and the reason I have stuck with it for so long is because I always have a ton of fun when I am on the ice (well, except for when we are doing conditioning). Skating around the rink is exhilarating, and scoring a goal, in an important game especially, is the greatest feeling in the world. But like anything, whether it be school or painting or woodworking, being a good hockey player does not happen overnight. It takes years of literal blood, sweat, and tears to become a master. My parents are both extremely hard working people; and seeing how much time and effort they put into their work motivated me to do the same in hockey.
The reason I combined working hard with being a role model is I believe in leading by example. If somebody is in charge of a group project, and is constantly telling other members of a group how and when to do things, but that person doesnÕt seem to know how or simply not want to put in the effort himself, how can he be considered a leader? It would seem as if he is unfit for being in charge. On the other hand, a leader who knows what he is doing and is able to give constructive criticism on what or what not to do in a certain situation is worth listening to in my eyes. Leaders are people who put in more work than is expected of them at all times, even when some of that work goes unnoticed. Leaders can not be leaders for the wrong reasons; they must be selfless. If you genuinely work hard at something, then you will see results. That is the point when whatever it is you are working for becomes fun. 
Some people say that winning isnÕt everything, and thatÕs true in some aspects. Sometimes losing is the best reminder of what winning feels like, but 9 times out of 10 you will not hear somebody say that they had a better time losing a game or failing a test than they did winning or passing. It just doesnÕt happen. Putting winning and losing aside though, if you donÕt thoroughly enjoy doing whatever it is you are doing, then nothing matters. The reason I stuck with hockey for so long while I watched most of my friends I grew up with stop playing over the years, is that I truly love to play the game. There have been countless times where I have been ready to give it all up and quit, but I had a goal to play college hockey and if I had quit I would not have achieved that goal.","100598064"

I believe in simple acts of kindness, not just because it's good to be a nice person but because you can very easily change someone's life with something as basic as a smile and never even realize that you made an impact. I discovered the true effects of kindness only a few months ago on my high schoolÕs senior retreat. I went to an all girlÕs catholic high school in Los Angeles and it was a truly amazing place. YouÕd walk on campus and see so many different kinds of people. I definitely didnÕt know everyone in my grade, even though my school wasnÕt huge, but everyone knew Oliver. He is one of quite a few transgender students that is/was a student at Immaculate Heart and he was probably one of the kindest people on campus. I wasnÕt very close with him for the majority of my time at Immaculate Heart but we ran in similar circles so whenever IÕd see him on campus I would say hi or smile and wave. I didnÕt really think much about it at the time because I knew a lot of people on campus between classes, soccer and clubs but I soon found out the true impact my actions had on him. As I said, Oliver was one of the kindest people on campus, but he was also one of the saddest. He struggled with depression and anxiety all throughout high school and his family did not support his transition at all which placed a lot of pressure on him to be someone he wasnÕt. While I had heard about these issues in passing from friends it wasnÕt until Kairos (our senior retreat) when Oliver told me everything himself, including showing me scars and opening up about a lot of personal information, and then went on to thank me for always making him feel wanted on campus. I was absolutely shocked and asked him what he meant seeing as we rarely exchanged more than a few words on any given day and he explained that every time I waved or yelled greetings to him across the hall it would brighten his day and make him feel like he mattered to someone that really had no motive to care about him. It took a while for everything he was saying to register with me but when it did I began to think about how our small actions, which we don't even think about, can be the difference in someone's day, week month, year or life. It doesnÕt have to be a huge gesture or an unforgettable moment, itÕs as simple as validating the existence of another human being regardless of whether or not you know them. Now Oliver is one of my closest friends and it all started with a smile in the hallway. This experience showed me that kindness changes lives in so many ways and that itÕs really the little things that count. I believe simple act of kindness can be the difference maker for you or your peers and I try to live by this belief every single day and to the best of my ability.

Beliefs are something everyone has: It is truly something that makes a person unique. These beliefs very from person to person, culture to culture. My personal beliefs are quite simple - I believe that you can only learn and improve by first making mistakes. 
In my lifetime I have learned so many things. But before I learned those things I needed to first make the mistake then make the correction. I obviously didnÕt come into the world knowing everything that I need to know, if I did I donÕt think I would be enrolled in college here. All of my mistakes and all of the lessons I learn from them have given me tons of life experience and even helps build bonds with others. 
My overall belief is mainly based of my history of playing baseball. Playing this sport has helped me grow up in many ways and has taught me many things. I learned that it ok to fail and that I will have an opportunity to make adjustments and try again next time. I expect to fail only to come back stronger next time where I will succeed making that success that much better. My beliefs make me the man I am today and IÕm proud of what I have accomplished. My beliefs gave me a strong work ethic and a drive to succeed in situations where I am expected to fail. 
Failure is a part of life. I believe one should correct it not dwell it. I never accepted failure and I don't believe anyone should. I believe most people have the drive to correct themselves and improve. One needs to fall before they can pick themselves up and the more you fall the quicker you learn to pick yourself up faster. That is my belief.

Taking a Chance, Being Adventurous
When I took my entrance exam for Classical High School I was given a choice, what language did I want to study? There was little boxes for Spanish, Italian, Latin, French and Japanese. The idea of taking Spanish, my parents native tongue, just did not seem to excite me. Although I can speak Spanish, and misgender everything, I did not know how to really read or write, so essentially I would be starting from square one. With Latin, my middle school only offered Latin and I had neutral feelings towards it. I ended up deciding that I wanted to try something new, I was already into manga and anime so I figured why not learn Japanese?
Taking Japanese is still hands down the best decision I have ever made. I took it all four years in high school and learned so many things that I thought I would never learn in a high school course. We threw in class parties and made traditional dishes to try, we would hose festivals and dress up. Luckily in my first year Japanese high school students were coming to visit and needed host families to stay with, and my parents were onboard with the idea. I went from being an only child who spoke barely any Japanese, to having to Japanese sisters who barely spoke English, and despite the language barrier we had a blast. In volunteering to host as a freshman, I unknowingly secured myself a spot on a government paid trip to Japan. I was in my second year when my teacher told me that she had five spots left for what was suppose to be for third and fourth year only students. It was two weeks before the departure date, I went and told my parents I was going, regardless of how they felt. I knew an opportunity like that happens once and a lifetime and I wasn't going to let it go past me. 
I finally got to see the country that I invested a lot of time into learning about, I stayed with a family, went to a high school, and saw endless gorgeous temples. When I returned home I decided that no matter how hard Japanese gets it was something I wanted to continue studying, for the rest of my life. IÕve hosted five girls, and have been in contact with nearly all of them despite having only meeting them for a brief period of time. I love my sisters and their my motivation to improve my Japanese, I want to be able to go back and thank them for letting me host them, thank their families for trusting their child to an American family they never met, and for teaching me an invaluable lesson of understanding and embracing different cultures.
If I do not make it as a wildlife and conservation biology major, I know I can do something with my Japanese. I believe that if I had not taken the chance of taking a language out of my comfort zone, I would not have the unbelievable experiences, friends, and connections I have today. I believe everyone should do something unique and special to them, despite what people say. If you are passionate about it, go for it. You will be rewarded in so many different ways. It is hard to think about what would high school, interests, and life now would be like if I had not taken that chance. I would not be where I am today without my parents unwavering support and my Sensei Ms. Morimura.","100560509"

One belief that I have always had throughout my whole life is that if you spread positivity it will benefit you mentally. I think if you go about your day being positive to everyone around you that you will be a happier person. I enjoy spreading positivity because it makes me feel better as a person knowing I can make people smile and laugh. I try to make people laugh because you never know how their day is going and that one laugh that I caused could be the thing that changes their day around. Sometimes if youÕre having a bad day a good joke or comment that makes you laugh is all you need to keep you going. I also believe that if I spread positivity that when I need positivity karma will help me out by making me happy. I tend to not focus on the negative aspects of life because if you go through your life only thinking of negative things you will not see all the positive things around you. People who focus and worry about negative things will miss all the good opportunities that life has to offer and they will just remain miserable. When I start to think about negative things I surround myself with people who make me smile and laugh and the bad thoughts fade away in my head. I think that a good smile or laugh is enough to help you power through a tough day or a tough time in your life. I feel like no matter what the situation is that there is a positive aspect about it that is not usually seen when someone is upset. I enjoy giving people advice who are upset because I look at the situation through a different mindset and offer an insight they may not have realized. I help the people find a positive aspect about their situation and help them understand how much they have in their life. When I get sad or upset, I like to think about everything that I have and how fortunate I am to have my life. I have had a pretty rough childhood with my parentÕs divorce and trouble with the law so I think I have a pretty good understanding of some aspects of life. I have learned from all the mistakes I have made and without those mistakes I would not be the person I am today. I think that getting in trouble so much has changed my mindset and makes me think more positive about my life and other peoples. Since I had such a rough time with high school I enjoy helping others with their problems because I have been in similar situations and it always feels good to have someone there for you when you need it. I would like to be the person people come too when they are upset or having issues because I actually enjoy giving people advice and helping them realize all the positive things that they have in their lives. I promote positive thinking and try to have an open mind about everything because I feel like it makes me more understanding. When someone has an issue and needs to talk to someone, I would like to be there for them because I remember when I had nobody I could talk too and it was very difficult for me. When people explain their problems to me I put myself in their shoes and try to look at the situation through their perspective. My main belief is to spread positivity to as many people as you can because you never know how that could impact their day or how they are feeling. There are no negative aspects about spreading positivity the only thing that can come out of it is making other people happy there are no downsides.   ","100588988"

I enjoy spending time with my family. I believe that family is very important to everyone.  This can be as simple as were all in a car driving somewhere or hanging out together eating dinner. A quote that I also believe that can relate to me and my family is a quote written by Kurt Vonnegut. The quote is, ÒEnjoy the little things in life for one day youÕll look back and realize they were the big thingsÓ. I think that this quote explains how me and my family are around one another. I come from a big family where my uncles and aunts were born in Dominican Republic. They all enjoy visiting Dominican Republic during the summer to see family members they havenÕt seen all year. They had gifts to give them and was looking to spend time together. 
Last summer all my uncles, aunts and my family decided to take a group vacation to dominican republic. Before going we found out that my uncle was very ill. Since we knew he was ill be took precaution on the this we did but still tried to do activities he could participate in. At that time I tried not to think of it to much, and  was thinking he will get better soon with doctors. This wasnÕt the case he soon ended up passing away not too long this spring. When I look back to our vacation I can remember doing all of the fun things with him. One is example was when he called some of his friends over and called us to come. His friends started to perform for us by singing and dancing. This was a big thing because my uncle always tried to keep things positive. Even though he was hurting on the inside he would have a smile on his face. Another thing is that he never liked being left behind. This was a little thing at first that then we all realized was big. He didnÕt like being left behind because it would make him feel depressed. So to make it feel better we would try including him in all the tasks we did like going to the beach, river, seeing performances. 
Finally, what IÕm trying to explain is that when I look back at all these memories I can see that all the little things we did for him were actually big this that meant a lot to him. Family are the people who care the most about you whenever. Even if you do something good/bad are sick or healthy they're always around. During that time I was with my family I enjoyed everyday being their. People now in days are always on their phones. When they got somewhere new they are always taking pictures sending messages and posting things and they donÕt value what their seeing completely. When I went to visit I was in a new environment without technology and actually having to talk to people face to face rather than on a phone. This showed me a different insight into capturing the moments I was living.  I had lots of good laughs like seeing my little cousins chase chickens around, to seeing my mom and aunt push each other into a pool. This is why I believe that family is important and that we should  enjoy little things in life because when you look back to them they are actually big things.

The saying Òeverything evens outÓ is not just a saying, it is a fact of life.  Change in life is inevitable, and I believe that getting too high or too low on yourself is foolish.  If a significant other leaves you, or you fail an exam, or whatever it may be, do not let it dictate the way you go about your day or how you live your life.  I believe that this is a great guiding principle for how to live, and it holds true for the emotional, social, and intellectual aspects of life.  
Keeping the saying Òeverything evens outÓ in mind when dealing with everyday social and emotional situations is extremely helpful.  If I am having a rough day emotionally, I try not to beat myself up over it or let it affect how I interact with others, because I know that the next day will be completely different for me and the emotions will even out.  The same goes for interacting with others, whether it be friends, family, or a significant other.  Everyone is dealing with their own personal conflicts, and I try to always keep this in mind when having a conversation with a friend or whoever it may be.  A person could act a certain way towards you one day, and then act completely differently the next; it all evens out.  The aspect that I try to be the most conscious of is the quality and healthiness of a relationship that I have with a person.  If I can express myself and truly be myself around a person, that is a healthy relationship.  From a relationship aspect, if I feel as though my significant other is dictating the way I feel in a negative way or causing me stress, I break it off.  It is simply not a healthy way to live life.    
The prevalence of social media has also greatly influenced how people perceive the world.  Social media gives the illusion that everyoneÕs life is a series of extreme highs and extreme lows.  In reality, this is not the case.  Everyone experiences highs and lows; they are simply a part of life.  What matters is how a person balances out these highs and lows and how the ride that is life goes for them in the long run.  That is what dictates the quality of a personÕs life.  Getting too high on yourself just makes the lows that much worse, and getting too low on yourself is unhealthy because nothing ever stays constant in life and things will improve.  
I believe that living by the saying Òeverything evens outÓ is an extremely effective approach to life.  In no way am I inferring that a person should not work hard or make bad life choices because Òeverything evens outÓ.  Our lives are constantly changing, and becoming fixated on one aspect or relationship just because of the way it makes you feel, whether it is positive or negative, is not a healthy approach to life.

For years people have claimed seeing flying objects in the sky. These strange flying objects are UFOÕs and they visit our planet regularly. Many different countries around the world have their own records of sighting of UFOÕs. Television, movies, books, real life stories and ancient cave paintings have all supported the fact that aliens exist. Ancient hieroglyphs described how they saw strange beings come down from the sky. I strongly believe that aliens do exist and that these UFOÕs visit Earth on a regular basis. I believe that Earth is not the only planet that has life form on it. Our galaxy is too big to not believe there are other life forms living out there. I think that out in our universe there is a planet or even planets that are homes to these aliens. Every year the amount of near collisions with UFOÕs increase. There are countless reports of planes that have witnessed UFOÕs on their ride. There have been many reported sightings and there's also been times where events have occurred and the government has tried to cover it up. I think the government is hiding the evidence of aliens. For example there is a United States Air Force facility in Nevada known as Area 51. The facility's purpose is unknown or kept secret because there is historical evidence that it is used to test extraterrestrial aircrafts. With the intense security and secrecy about the facility it is obvious that the government is trying to hide something from the public. Countless times NASA has tried to cover up events and this leads people to believe they are hiding the fact that aliens exist. Not only is the government hiding these facts from us but so are astronauts. Astronauts have the best chance of sighting aliens when they are on a mission. However it is said that these astronauts are sworn to secrecy if they are to encounter one on their trip. The government doesn't want to start panic with the facts that there is life outside of earth. If humans knew there was another planet outside of Earth that could be accessed there would be people trying to leave to explore and this new planet. People have reported their own experience of aliens making an appearance on earth and probing humans. Astronomers have done the math and calculated that there should be thousands if not millions of other planets that are capable of having life on them. I have a few other friends who I became closer ith over this topic because it gets us so freaked out about what we are not being told. There is rock hard evidence that aliens exist and the government needs to tell the public about what they are keeping secret from us. This universe is too big to have just one planet with living creatures on it. We should know what else is out there. ","100588845"

Let's All Just be Equal
I believe that everyone on this planet is equal. I am a strong activist for the LGBTQ+ community, the Feminist community and any other group that wants everyone to be equal, I will fight for. I have feminist beliefs because my mother and grandmother are both strong feminists. We believe that women are equal to men in every way, and therefore women should be treated equally. Women should not be paid less just because they are women, women should be allowed to go on maternity leave without being penalized and women should have a right to their own body. Women should be allowed to dress as they want without being judged. We should stop judging the victims, but instead protect the victim and immediately blame the one causing the pain. The whole idea of blaming the victim blows my mind, along with the idea that women make only 3/4th of what men make within the same job. I also am a feminist because we need more strong women in the world. There are not many women in the science and math fields, and I wish to break down those walls. I will become a Marine Biologist one day and I will work beside both men and women to help make our environment a better place. Now, I would like to clarify that I do not hate men. I simply believe that men should step aside a bit and make room for women because we are smart too and itÕs time for men to no longer be in charge. We need women in leadership rolls, we need women in science, we need women activists. Honestly, we just need women to feel comfortable with their life and not feel like they have to stay at home all the time like the perfect ÔhousewifeÕ. Not to say that they canÕt be, but they just should not feel that they have to. good.
I am also a strong believer that people should be allowed to love who they love. I know several people within the LGBTQ+ community and there is no difference between them and everyone else. They still love the same way, can get hurt the same way, and have feelings, just like everyone else. Many couples that are within this community are discriminated against. They have a harder time getting jobs, making friends, and sometimes they have a harder time in school because of the way they are made fun of. So many people in this community decide to kill themselves because they feel that no one will ever accept them. I find that the saddest and horrible thing, and that is why I fight for their rights. Of course they should allow to marry. I canÕt believe that was ever even a question. Just because they donÕt necessarily follow your beliefs, does not mean that you can tell them what they can and canÕt do. To be honest this entire essay does not really have one set belief, it is more my ranting about how wrong it is for people to be treated badly just because they are ÔdifferentÕ. We must remember as a society that everyone is equal, we are all just human, and therefore we should not treat each other differently just because of their gender, sexual orientation or skin color.","100588513"

I believe success is measured by many different things, but the most important aspects are gratitude and happiness. Not how much money you make or what job you have or what society dictates. If I am not happy or I do not recognize the chances IÕve been given, I cannot consider myself successful. There are many aspects of success, more than I could ever begin to list. Overall, every experience contributes in its own special way.
I am only 19 and yet already I have changed my mind about what makes me happy hundreds if not thousands of times. In my freshman year of college I changed my major three times until I finally found something I am interested in. Or at least something I think I am interested in. I have the luxury of knowing my parents will be proud of me no matter what I choose, and for that I am eternally grateful. I know many people do not have that comfort and their ÒsuccessÓ is dictated by others around them. Perhaps their parents are pushing them to go to med school or be an engineer, but I get to choose my own interests, which my parents understand is not any one thing. I am able to change my mind and find my own way in life, my own success, my own happiness. I can never thank my parents enough for the freedom they have given me. I believe gratitude is a large part of success.
I also love to travel, but with a purpose. I feel like being in one place for too long inhibits my ability to grow and learn about the world around me. I thrive on new experiences that challenge my thoughts and ideals. I travel with my dad every winter to a new place and every time I learn something new and am confronted with an aspect of humanity I hadnÕt experienced before. In Greece this past winter my father and I came across a man from the Middle East who went home for a wedding and was stuck there for six months due to his ethnicity before being able to return to Greece. He watched friends and family get shot in front of him yet retold the story of his life to us as though we were now a part of his family. I could never imagine being in his shoes, but I felt a little more connected to him and humanity that day. 
I believe success is knowing you have a good life, and are happy with who you are, but it is also recognizing the fact that so many people do not have the opportunities you do. In order to be successful you must also be compassionate, empathetic, and aware of the challenges facing humanity. If you cannot appreciate the fortune you have, how will you ever know your true happiness?
I strive to make an impact. All my life when asked what I plan to do with my life I responded ÒI plan to change the world.Ó In all seriousness, I do plan to change the world. It may not be on a large scale, it could simply be making a positive impact on someone elseÕs life. On the other hand, I could play a role in mitigating clean water issues that affect so much of the world. However, my ultimate plan is to be happy, and make every experience count. If I can manage that, I can call my life a great success.","100560125"

I believe the two most valuable things you can do in life are working hard and being kind. Hard work and kindness are my core values because to me they are the most important tools to being happy and successful in life. They are also so close to me because they are two simple tasks that anyone can do at any time but at the same time it is something that took me many lessons to learn.
Hard work is the first and arguably the most important of these values to me. I put so much emphasis on having a good work ethic because it applies to all areas of life, anything you ever want if you work hard for it you can go get it. I attempt to carry this mentality into all aspects of my life whether it is in football, school, or just an activity I am doing for fun. I always set goals for myself and work as hard and as long as I need to attain that goal. This was not just something I started doing overnight though. My father was the one that instilled this good work ethic in me at a young age. As a blue collar worker I watched him go to work every morning and get home late every night doing hard manual labor all day to provide a great life for my family. Not only did he do the work every day but the times he brought me with him I saw the effort and care he put into all of his work. He showed me by example just how important hard work is to not just him and I but everyone.
Being kind is the second core value I live my life by. My junior year of high school my best friends mom who I was so close to I would consider a mother of my own took her own life. I was there for my best friend right away because I thought he would need me but in actuality I realized it was I who needed him. His mother had always been a large supporter of a nonprofit organization that sold necklaces and other items all with the same two words on them ÒBe KindÓ. I always saw these words and thought I understood them but it was not until this all transpired that I really got it. I learned from my best friend not through words but action that being kind is about treating everyone and everything with the utmost respect and kindness that you have to offer. No matter who you think you know you will never know their full story and what goes on in their life so it is only right to be kind every moment you live. Every morning I wake up and put on the same necklace with these words on it because each time I look down I am reminded of its importance. 
Core values need to be something that you really embody and not just things you say you do but donÕt. I know myself that I wake up each morning and give my full effort and express my kindness to everyone I know because that is all I can do. Each individual only has so much control in this world and if I work my hardest and treat everyone right I am confident I did all in my power to make the world a better place.","100596004"

Many people have personal beliefs that shape them into the type of person they are. One of my personal beliefs is that if you work hard enough, success will be easily achieved. I took this personal belief very seriously around the time when I started high school. This specific time is where my personal belief turned out to be true when I ran an obstacle race known as a Spartan Race. The Spartan Race is a true test of physical strength boasting a ten kilometer course with over twenty-five obstacles. I knew that I couldnÕt just show up to this grand challenge without any preparation, so I had to work hard to ensure that I would be able to cross that finish line in one piece.
During the summer of 2012, I tried my best to meet the expectations to run this Spartan Race successfully. Me and my other friends, Zak and Justin, decided to start working on upper body strength and our cardio. We built up our cardio from running one mile for a workout up to four miles. I always avoided running, because I was always horrible at it. This was a huge improvement for me. Our strength increased as we lifted old dumbbells that were in our houses. We tried to get the most out of the time we had to train. By the end of summer, I felt very satisfied with my work. I could run farther than I ever have previously, and I could feel the difference in my strength and muscle mass. I was physically ready for this race, but I was terrified deep down that I wonÕt make it to the finish line.
When it was time to walk up to the starting line with Zak and Justin, I was more nervous than ever. I had ten kilometers and over twenty-five obstacles between me and the that finish line. I ran up and down the mountains of the course in the early September heat, my cardio training actually paid off. I lost my shirt around the halfway point as I continued to persevere. The obstacles were challenging, but surprisingly manageable. I had to lift heavy objects like logs and sandbags, I even had to climb uphill while carrying them. I had to crawl under barbwire for what seemed like forever, cutting and bruising my body in the process. IÕve had to use my upper body like never been able to do before. IÕve climbed up ropes and swung from monkey bars. I thought that I would never be able to do the things I did in that race. IÕm proud to say that I only failed three obstacles, as I had to do only thirty ÒburpeesÓ for each failed obstacle. As I thought the gauntlet of torment would never end, I saw the finish line. I powered through the group of ÒGladiatorsÓ who guarded the finish line. They hit me with giant Q-tip staffs as I passed through the finish line.
Passing through that finish line was probably my greatest accomplishment at the time, as I have done what I thought was impossible. After committing to intense training, I was able to manage a monster of a challenge like the Spartan Race. I then believed that anything can be easily achieved if you train or persevere hard enough. I took this belief to heart as I did three more Spartan races later on and participated in winter track and lacrosse in high school.","100579299"

I have believed that if you really want something, you will get it with hard work or dedication. This may be kind of hard to hear from me because I am a huge slacker, however, the things I want I will get. This realization came to me in high school through sports and personal relationships. For example, I was new to the sports of football and wrestling, especially coming from a town with two really good teams. I remember being in middle school kind of going through the motions. However, when I reached my freshman year of high school, I was thrown into varsity wrestling, having never been on a varsity team in my life. Even though I was under experienced, I tried my best during the season, placing in some of my first tournaments ever. The next season however, I put in the work to get my varsity spot back, as well as to become a better wrestler. That season, I lost only 2 regular meet matches during the season and placed in many of the tournaments we participated in. Due to the work I put in, I was made team captain as a junior and easily became a contender in Rhode Island wrestling. Along with this story, I can also prove that putting in work will create success. I had a longtime girlfriend in high school, and she really didnÕt like me much when we met. However, I kept being persistent over a few months, and she eventually started to like me more and more. In the end, we dated for a really long time and had a great relationship, almost like dating a best friend. If I were to pick any famous athlete or movie star or any other celebrity, their stories may be the same: they started from the bottom. Once the work is put in and you have in your mind that you can accomplish anything, you will see results you want. When IÕm trying to get things that I want, I will do whatever I can to get to the top.","100570796"

The first thing that came to my mind when I was reading this assignment was my experiences working for a home health care company.  IÕve worked as a home health aid for this company for three years now, and it has been the best and worst experiences of my life.  So many stories came to my mind when I sat down to write this, but the most prominent one that fits this scenario would be when I ran into a situation in which I had to either obey my patientÕs wishes, or call an ambulance.
I signed a contract when this company employed me that I would obey all the HIPAA laws, so there is not much about this scenario I can actually reveal.  This patient of mine is a functioning paraplegic, and on my very first day working with her she had me promise her that if she ever did not answer the door, to not call 911 and simply turn around an go home.  Initially, I promised her I would.  It was my first day on the job, and I of course wanted her to like me and feel comfortable around me, so I promised.  
I never realized that this promise was a bad thing until one day a few summers ago when she did not come and open the door for me when I rang the bell at the start of my shift.  The first thing I always do when a patient does not answer the door is call the office.  In this case, the office instructed me to keep ringing the bell and they would call her emergency contacts so I did as I was instructed.  A few minutes later they called back and told me the next thing to do would be to call 911, for she could be seriously injured and just unable to answer the door.  It occurred to me that my patients life could be at danger, so without even thinking I called 911.  Am ambulance came and the EMTÕs opened the door, and in fact my patient had fallen.  She was ok, and everything was fine, and in the end she thanked me for not obeying her wishes and doing what I had to do to make sure she was ok.
When I think back on this story and why I acted as I did, I know that my personal belief definitely came into play.  I definitely put the care of others over my own, which is why I am a health studies major.  I knew that even if my patient would not be happy with my decision, that she would be healthy and okay.  I am not sure if this is simply how I was raised or how I was brought up to me, but I know for sure that this is what I believe and how I will always aim to live my life.  In life, one should always strive to do as they believe and not let what others say or do influence them in any way.","100560125"

Everything Happens for a Reason
Core values are shaped through instances that happen in life. A major reason why things happen is because of choice. Every day I make choices that shape the outcome of the day. There are different paths that I can take and I choose the one that will benefit me the most. Sometimes I may have to make sacrifices in order to make others around me happy. But many times I am not able to make a choice. There are occasions when something does not go my way, but I believe everything happens for a reason. I have experienced countless moments where I have chosen a path or been on a path that may not have been what I imagined. However, imaginations are only concepts and are not real. Not everything happens like it was first envisioned. 
In eighth grade I played three sports. I always gave it my all and I excelled in every single one of them. Then again, the following year I was going into high school and I knew I would not have enough time to play all three. I wanted to focus primarily on one sport but I was unsure on what direction to take. What I did know, was that I wanted to be really good at one sport and put forth all my effort into it. The three sports I played were football, baseball, and golf. I loved being on a team sport. There was nothing better than going out to eat with the team after a long game. I took every aspect into consideration. My dad played golf in college and could have turned professional. My brother played golf and baseball in high school and I thought about how much he enjoyed them both. My sister played golf and was a phenomenal player. When the time came at the end of eighth grade, I decided I wanted to play a team sport. I did not want to lose the friends I had in middle school. I wanted to feel comfortable and have relationships with people through the sport in high school. 
The summer going into high school was tough. I placed myself in as many baseball and football camps as possible to get a feel for both sports. I knew at the end of the day I was going to choose one of the two. My dad believed I could get a scholarship in either or if I continued to play it throughout high school. In the middle of the summer, I played in what would be my last baseball game ever. I broke my hand and could not play for the rest of the year. It was very hard on me to understand I would not be able to play.
My mom always told me it would all work out no matter what came my way. She would say to me Òeverything happens for a reason, my dearÓ. Through hard times, I seemed to really understand my surrounding environment. After my hand healed up, I played golf with my family and enjoyed the last of the days I had of summer. Those moments playing golf with family brought me closer to them and with the sport. My passion grew instantly. I began practicing harder than I ever had before. I realized that one day I want to play with my family when I am older. Golf is a sport I could play my whole life. I was tired of getting injured in football and baseball and I wanted to remain healthy. At the last second I tried out for the high school golf team. I made varsity as a freshman and had a tremendous first season. 
Golf was not my first choice. It is a very independent sport and I would spend several hours of the day practicing by myself. The injury really set me back but I would always keep my momÕs words in the back of my head with whatever I did. Today, I am playing golf at the University of Rhode Island and I am receiving a great education. I could not be any more satisfied with where I am at. I continue to look at decisions I need to make carefully. But once I choose a direction I never look back. I take that route and know that everything happens for a reason.

I believe in treating others with respect no matter who they are. When I was younger I watched some videos in my elementary school. The videos were about integrity and other such actions that people are expected to have. The videos were very cheesy now that I think about it. The videos said to ask if you want anything and say ÒpleaseÓ or Òthank youÓÊwhen talking with others. The way the video projected things was very low key and easy to understand. Even though I was young I was able to get part of it although not all of it. The part that I got the most out of it was the music videos. After every episode the TV show would have a song at the end that was about what the episode went over. Just like the Bill Nye the science guy videos did. I think the most important part back then was the music videos I got to listen to. Now the most important thing from the videos was something they called the Ògolden ruleÓ The golden rule in the video is Òto treat others the way you want to be treated.Ó ÊSo that became one of my core beliefs as I grew up. I want to respect people because I want to be respected in turn. I believe I canÕt expect to be respected if I donÕt try to respect others first. As I grew up I learned about other problems the society I live has that has to do with respecting others. I was introduced into stereotypes. When I first had an in depth discussion about it I thought people were talking about types of stores that you can listen to. So I started looking around the classroom for a stereo system. Obviously my looking around was in vain because stereotyping isnÕt a physical thing, it is a psychological thing. I learned that day that there are people who fit into a certain type. I learned that almost every person is put into a metaphorical group that is arranged by one characteristic or multiple characteristics. I learned that people have judged a person just by looking at them. They put them into a group and put them down by saying unjust things. I learned that people see Americans as a group of fat people who do whatever they want. It was a real shock for me when I was in middle school. However, as I grew older I saw other stereotypes that people produced. One group of people who used stereotypes and such were political cartoonists. They used stereotypes to make fun of other people who used them to put others down. I realized that even if some things are used to show negative stuff I donÕt have to follow the crowd. I found one of my core beliefs in an improved form. I thought that I would tell myself to think about people with integrity. I wouldnÕt allow myself to treat people a certain way just because other people do it that way. So I will say it once again. My core belief is that I will treat others with respect no matter what others say about this person.

Something I have believed above anything growing up has been that hard work is the key to success in any field. Anything is obtainable as long as the time is put into working towards that goal. If that goal is to learn how to play an instrument, the only way to become good at it is to practice. If someone wants to play at a high level for sports, they need to put the time into proper conditioning and nutrition along with plenty of practice time. The most common of all goals, success in academic fields, can be only achieved through study and research in their field. No person every obtained anything meaningful simply by looking at something. It takes a solid work ethic to become successful at something.
I always felt a work ethic is hard to maintain, but I know that when I put the work in, I will be successful. Anytime I failed a test, there was never a question about it. I knew the reason I failed was because I was lazy and did not study enough. Although I have done this more than I care to admit, there have been more occasions where I did work hard, and succeeded because of it. I play several instruments, but guitar is my most prominent. I have been playing since sixth grade, and it is only through countless hours of practicing that it became something I am proud of. Many late nights, and countless frustrations occurred in the process, but I overcame the adversity through hard work. I have spent several hours straight with a metronome working on one guitar riff over and over until I had it down perfectly. I find that many people give up on learning an instrument quickly because they see no progress. Learning an instrument requires time, it is not something that can be picked up overnight. If the effort and time was put in, they would get better at whatever instrument they are trying to learn.
A problem I find that people have is they lack finding the motivation to do something. I have struggled with school in the past because of a lack of motivation. I find that my own academic success has never been enough motivation for me to do well for whatever reason. IÕve always had to look to other things to motivate me to focus on my academic work. The end of my senior year was one of my strongest academic performances. My motivation? Not having to take any finals. I put the effort in, and managed to pull all AÕs in some fairly tough courses. Musically my motivation has always been trying to keep up with my friends, who are extraordinary musicians in their own regards. I find that the most effective way to be hardworking is to have motivation to do the work.
I find that the only way to get anywhere is to work hard. Through hard work, anything can be accomplished. People who say they cannot do something, simply are not trying hard enough. My work ethic, while bad sometimes, is something I am incredibly proud of. It is what enables to do well in school, and eventually get me through engineering. It is for these reasons that I firmly believe that hard work is the key to success.","100589652"

I believe in people being treated properly and respectfully no matter what because we are all human beings. When I was about ten years old, my brother had social anxiety that took over his life and affected everyone around him, me especially. As little sisters do I look up to my older brother, but for this time in his life I grew more distant and became afraid. 
Becoming more afraid of him, made me scared to go home from school and I felt unsafe in my home. He had times where he lashed out and went crazy and put the well-being of me and my parents in jeopardy. I remember my parents hiding me behind laundry baskets full of clothes and putting blankets over me to make sure I would not get hurt. 
The first time I went to visit my brother at Bradley Hospital I was scared and closed minded that anyone who went there was a bad person. My parents had to help me get the courage to walk through those doors. They said things like ""your brother would love to see you"" or ""it would make him feel better about this situation"". They got through to me and I went. The rooms were small and two people shared one room. Since I wasn't really aware of what a college dorm looked like back then I connected it to a jail cell. I felt that my brother did not deserve be separated from his family and that strangers would not help him.
Seeing how my brother was treated made me scared to grow up. I kept thinking what if I end up like him. The worse part about it was wherever we went people knew; when you come from a small town like Bristol everyone knows everyone's business. People would say horrible things about my brother with me three feet away from them. Then I came to the realization that they were wrong. He was not a bad person; they were bad people for talking about a fourteen year old. I realized I should not be afraid to be there for him. My family and I started going to therapy to help confront our feelings about everything. Since I was only ten, I sat there and listened to what everyone else said. Fully understanding how my brother felt made it easier for me to help him through this. I had to act normally as though nothing had changed. Over time he had gotten over his fear. His social anxiety was hardly noticeable, he is still shy in certain situations but he has overcome his biggest obstacle and I have become more open minded and aware of others. This lead me to who I am today because I feel that I am a nonjudgmental person. You always hear that you do not know what other people are going through. This clicked in mind, I started not seeing people just who they were on the outside.  
This experience led me to realize that people who have some problems should not be sent away from loved ones. I became more open minded to the idea of not everyone is perfect, as I thought my brother was. People who have problems like this are looked down on by society, we should open our hearts and be compassionate and help them deal with the burden they have.  
To summarize I believe in that people should be treated as human beings and not treated differently or objectively based on something such as a mental illness or deformity. My brother was treated poorly by people we knew and judged. It opened my eyes that equality of all form such as race, gender, sex, and illness are all based on social standards. I have become a more caring and compassionate person because I believe in equality and being treated fairly. ","100595690"

I grew up in a very irish-catholic familyÉ a good example of a moral/mindset of this category of the catholic religion is that ÒitÕs a sin to drink and itÕs a sin to spill your beerÓ... I know this little joke sounds very stereotypical but itÕs ok because I'm one of them so I'm allowed to joke about it. 
Now that I have your attention, I feel that my catholic upbringing has shaped me to have a certain mindset of different situations. I have always believed that it is a good thing to love others the way you love yourself, to be thankful for the things you have and to love the life you were given, and to pay good deeds forward. Aside from my personal beliefs of God, Jesus, and general religion specific views, I think that the morals I have gained from going to church on Sundays for my whole life can be valid for almost anyone regardless of their religious or personal beliefs. I am pretty confident in this statement because there has been a time in my life where I was unsure if I truly believed in the Catholic religion; so, I decided to research other religions and try to understand how the rest of the world and religions view life; what we value as humans, where we go when we die, all the different variations and views on Òhigher powersÓ, reincarnation, scientific explanations, and so much more. 
Although I am very glad I had that stage of my life and was able to learn so much about the world and explanations of why IÕm here and who created me and my purpose on this Earth, I found myself back in Catholicism. After I realized catholicism was the religion for me, I was confirmed into the religion. Then I was able to take my morals from the catholic religion and put them into action. With my parish at home, I feel very lucky to have gone on two mission trips. The first to the H.O.M.E. Co-op compound in Maine to work with an extremely poverty stricken community; helping with the daycare, markets, landscape, and anything else they needed. However my most recent and impactful trip was to the Dominican Republic. While I was there, I was able to stay at The Mustardseed Orphanage and Community with over 20 orphans that were severely disabled with cerebral palsy, Down's Syndrome,  psychomotor delays, mental impairment, autism, epilepsy, physical deformations, deafness and blindness and a community heavily stricken with poverty and hardship. It was a very hard thing to witness however I feel that my morals of loving all people regardless of their abilities, background, or beliefs, being thankful for the things I have and to give to those who have nothing, and paying good deeds forward has really made this trip so much more effective and made my beliefs so much more real and valid in my everyday life. 
Although I think that every person should find a religion that they connect with on their own personal level, I personally feel very proud to be a Catholic.

I believe that the major medical companies and heads of the medical communities in America are corrupt. I believe that the people of America are lied to and live their everyday lives without seeming to care or bringing this issue to attention. It is sad to say/believe that those who are supposed to be creating medicines and advances in the medical field in order to help protect and save the lives of people do not as much care about the health of the people rather their incomes and the money that they will make. For example, I completely believe that there is, or could be, a treatment that could get rid of cancer, maybe not completely, however, the technological advances and intelligence of humans could find a treatment that nearly gets rid of cancer or other diseases/disabilities that do not require supplements. The medical community, especially those in high positions such as medical company heads, earn way more money by providing medications/treatments that people are required to take daily and have to continue to buy throughout their life if they want to suppress their disability or illness rather than providing such people with medications that may possibly get rid of the illness completely or for a longer span of time. This belief is along the same lines of which a lighting company could easily make light bulbs that never burn out or last a significant amount of time longer than those of which that are available to buy. However, if this were to be created people would not have to buy the product as much which would result in much less income for those companies. In this case, an example would be the treatment of someone with anxiety. Rather than developing something that could possibly get rid of the personÕs anxiety or a drug that suppresses the anxiety much longer, it is much more profitable for medical companies to make a drug that only lasts for a limited time which means that this person is forced to continually buy the drug in order to prevent the anxiety in this case. I wish to someday find a way to fix this problem and I believe that if I am not able too, one day someone will be able to fix the corruption and care more about the people and the health of the nation, even the world, and make treatments that help rid illnesses instead of minor medications that are designed to suppress the illness in order to make more money for themselves. Of course it is much easier said than done as a bystander, however, I think that there are more than enough capable people that will realize the health of themselves and others are more important than earning more money than they could possibly spend. I have believed this idea and have been upset by the corruption for as long as I began to take an interest in health sciences. This also helped me to realize that what I would love to do for a career would be to dedicate my life to helping others and developing the health of people around the world.

Family: Noun, a group consisting of parents and children living together in a household. Sometimes the dictionary gets a definition wrong, or doesnÕt explain it quite right. Sometimes the definition doesnÕt pertain to everyone. Like me, my definition of family does not include Òconsisting of parents and childrenÓ. My definition of family is anyone who is always there for you and has improved you to be a better person. They are a shoulder to lean on and theyÕre your biggest cheerleader. When I was little I used to think the perfect definition of a family was a mom and dad happily living in a house with a white picket fence and kids; the ÒAmerican dreamÓ. But as I grew up I learned that this wasnÕt true at all, and nor would I want that to be. My parents divorced when I was 5 and that time was a confusing time for an only child like me especially when I started living full time with my dad. It was a big change for my dad and I, but a complete 180 for him. But on the plus side we moved into a neighborhood with a lot of kids and thatÕs where the story of how I met the rest of my family begins. Being an only child meant I had to find my own fun and meet new people it just so happened that I had a whole pool of people around be to be with. My neighborhood was a mix of a whole bunch of different kids from different backgrounds and walks of life but somehow we all just meshed together. My best friend Chloe and I were always the oldest so we were like older sisters to everyone helping them with HW or whatever they needed. Felix my other best friend was the older brother. Hayley, Adian, Life, Sarah, and Lauren were the youngest so we watched out for them. We all would spend countless hours outside playing ÒpretendÓ games and just run around sometimes from sun up till sun down. The winter time was full of snowball fights, snowmen, and hot chocolate movie times.  Soon it just became normal to see each other in our houses it wasnÕt ÒCan Chloe come over?Ó is was ÒChloes here!Ó The time that I lived there with my neighborhood family yeiled some of the greatest memories that I have today. They shaped me into the person I am today and I am forever thankful. They taught me how to help others, have fun, and that family doesnÕt always have to be blood related. They changed my definition of family. I didnÕt want that to end but of course times change and people started to move and the neighborhood got quiet but our dynamic has never changed. To this day I still consider them my family just as much as my dad is. This I believe, that family is what you make of it and sometimes family is not always blood related.   ","100599768"

I believe that if I am afraid to struggle at something new in my life, then I will never succeed. I have noticed that when I struggle through something in my life, I become a better person in the end. I struggle and push myself past my comfort zone to reach the top. If something doesnÕt go right through my pathway, why not try looking at it differently? If something doesnÕt work the first time, that doesnÕt mean you should give up. 
When I was ten years old, I tried out for the dance company at the dance studio near my house. At this time, I had only been dancing for seven years. I felt like the youngest girl in the audition room because everyone looked so much older than me; my thought process was correct. The other girls that were also auditioning for the same group were older than me by a few years. Some of the girls were in the 8th grade, and some were in their sophomore year in high school. I felt very young being the only 5th grader in the audition. I wanted to pursue my dream and be apart of this dance company, so I didnÕt let the age gap between the girls and me keep me from auditioning. To my surprise, I was accepted onto the team at the age of ten years old when the dance instructors that are the executive directors of the company were looking for girls from the age of 12 years old to 18 years old. I felt very happy that I didn't give up and I didn't let the struggle of not having the same number of years of training like the other girls did keep me from auditioning. 
Throughout my first year in the dance company, I pushed myself out of my comfort zone and made new friends. An example of when I pushed myself in dance class was when I finally had the opportunity to start partnering with a boy. Being ten years old at the time, I was still very immature and thought that boys still had cooties. I never thought of holding a boyÕs hand at school, now I have to do partner work and have a boy hold my waist above his head. It was very uncomfortable and it took time to get used to since I was officially in the dance company and partnerwork was a normal thing to do. I failed multiple times in lifts in many performances and rehearsal that year, but I worked more and more in and out of dance class with my partner so that we could get the difficult lifts in the dance. One of my tricks that I learned throughout the eight years of being in the dance company and doing many different styles of partnerwork, if i didnÕt want my hand or my body to be sweating and slippery, I would hairspray my body and my hands before a rehearsal or a performance. Now, in my dancing career, I love to do partnerwork. In my senior year of highschool, I was praised on how far I have come in partnerwork and how much chemistry I can portray to the audience while dancing. 
Dance has been a struggle in many scenarios, but I have always pushed myself past my comfort zone to show myself that I can do more. In the end, I hoped that I would succeed, but I had to struggle and fail multiple times before getting to the end point of my goal. ÊI believe that if I am afraid to struggle at something new in my life, then I will never succeed. I will always try and push myself past my comfort zone, and possibly struggle, to reach the top.

The weekdays are hectic and full for adults and children and it is easy for families to lose touch and communication. Football practice, work, school, errands; the responsibilities to be handled in the course of one day, let alone one week, can make anybodyÕs head spin. Therefore, I strongly believe in the tradition of Sunday dinner. Sunday dinner is a time to reflect on the busy days of the past and prepare for the ones ahead. It is meant to bring families together after the stress of a long week, as a reminder of what really matters in life. Sunday dinner has always been a lighthouse, a safe haven, a comfort to my family and I. It has been a tradition since I was just a baby and will continue to be as I grow older and have a family of my own.
When I was a child, I was in constant limbo, moving from one house to another. I lived with just my mother for many years and we ate dinner together every night. No matter the apartment we were cramped in or the type of food we could afford, my mom never failed to provide a warm meal. However, the dinner she made on Sunday always trumped the others. Her smile was always brighter and the food always tastier. It was something about the way she could relax with me and focus on nothing but our time together that set it apart from the others. One Sunday every month, my mom and I spent 
This I Believe 2
Sunday dinner at my grandparentÕs house, where they cooked and cleaned for us. The laughter that filled those special nights will remain in my memory forever.
Now my mother and I spend Sunday dinners with my stepfather and younger brother. My mother and I prepare the meal as my dad and brother set the table. Once the work is done, we sit and enjoy each others company over hot plates of food after saying grace. Although the dynamic of family dinners on Sundays has changed, the comfort they bring to me remains. In the demanding world everyone survives in today, the gathering of families all over the world to indulge in love and food should be enjoyed at least once a week. While being in college and transitioning to a new routine and lifestyle, I still enjoy my Sunday dinner; now just with my friends. Every Sunday we gather and eat at our dining hall before a new week of classes begins. No matter where I am in life, I will set aside Sunday night as a time of reflection and relaxation with the people that I love. This tradition that my family has imparted onto me will stay with me as I grow and have my own children. No matter the circumstances of my future, I will make sure my family has a meal to enjoy every Sunday evening, just like my family and friends do for me. ","100589315"

I believe that you should treat people the way you want to be treated. Everyone should treat everyone, and their ideas and opinions, with at least the most basic respect. Regardless of skin color, religion, beliefs, looks, anything, everyone should treat each other just as they would want to be treated- with respect. There has been so many issues lately regarding groups of people shaming other groups for what they believe in or how they look; This is the most ignorant form of disrespect anyone could ever display. Just because someone does not believe the same things you do or is going through what you are, does not give you the right to disrespect their beliefs or advice, their opinion is just as valid as yours is. Every summer I go to a horseback riding camp in New Hampshire for the month of July. It is an all girls sleep away camp that girls from ages 8-16 attend from all around the world. There is always a wide range of opinions and beliefs in every single conversation, sometimes even language barriers making every interaction with anyone just as interesting as it can be. One afternoon, I was talking with my friends about how how some girls were moved up into the higher level and some girls had been kept down low instead of moving up like they should have. My friends and I were all experienced riders at the top level, and were talking to two girls from Spain who barely spoke English, trying to make them feel better about being placed into the second highest ring, telling them how we were once in their place too. The language barrier was hard enough to deal with, so everyone was a little aggravated already, but, there was a younger girl sitting next to us listening on to our conversation. At one point, she leaned over and told the girls to not worry about it so much, and that theyÕll move up when the time is right. The girls from Spain were upset enough, so they yelled back at her in very broken English that she does not understand how aggravating being held down is, and since she always has been in the lowest level of riding she does not understand. They screamed at her that all their friends are in the highest level and they are alone just below them all because they are just not good enough to make the cut, while she is at the bottom with all of her friends and has nothing to worry about. Their sudden harshness upset the little girl so much that she ran off scared and crying after just trying to help them feel better. This made me think, if the spanish girls will not accept the little girlÕs opinion and advice because she was not at the same riding level as they were, and was not going through the same difficulties as them, her opinion was invalid. If this is a basic and natural belief for teenage girls to act upon, they must hold the same attitude when it comes to more serious issues like accepting gay marriage, or accepting different religions trying to prove their legitimacy to others. If those same two girls were having a conversation about whether or not they think gay marriage should be legal, and a lesbian tried to give her opinion, would they yell at her saying they do not want her opinion because she is not straight so she is not going through the same difficulties choice wise as they are? I believe everyone should treat people the way they want to be treated, and that everyoneÕs opinion matters no matter what. Just because someone is not the same as you, or does not hold the same beliefs, that does not mean their argument is any more valid or invalid as yours is. If we all treat people equally and with as much respect and acceptance as possible, the world would be a much happier place.","100601388"

I believe that everyone is born equal and no one should think they better than anyone else. Everyone wants to be better than someone else and this steams from their own insecurities. But if you love yourself, then you wonÕt seek out the pleasure of making some feel low for your own selfish high. This is prevalent in my age group and with the use of social media it doesnÕt help, we are constant in competition with others. We compete to have the best body, relationship, jobs, etc. If we donÕt get the spot light or the recognition, we want for being perfect in the eyes of others than we lash out and hurt our self and those around us. You start to feel low and start question yourself worth and the love others have for you. The reason why this is my belief is that during the beginning of my high school years I felt less of a person and that I donÕt matter as much because I wasnÕt perfect. That I was less than my friend and everyone else.
In middle school I was a very awkward child. I was bigger than most girls my age, my hair was big and curly, and because I came from a low income family I didnÕt have the most fashion forward clothing. And this weird middle schooler only got older and more awkward and before I knew it I was in high school. In middle school it was acceptable to be like this, but in high school it wasnÕt. I felt like everyone got the upgrade and I was left behind. My freshman year was terrible, my friends had hit puberty and to top it off they had boyfriends who almost worshipped the ground the walked on, while I was stuck eating at my lunch table all alone. This affect my self-esteem so much and but me in such a funk, I felt the whole world was against me and I couldnÕt escape it because everyoneÕs happy life was plastered everywhere on social media. 
But what I didnÕt notice was that my depression was affecting everyone else around me. During Christmas break my great grandmother sat me down and told me what she had to go through when she my age. She had to compete with girls her own age but not only on looks but with basic human right. When she was younger she lived in Mississippi and had to deal with racism at every turn. She would have to tell herself that she was beautiful and unique, as well as that she had the same right as everyone else, even when ignorance was in her face screaming disgusting racist comments in her face. And I took this to heart, from that point I changed how I view myself and my life. I realized that I come from strong women and that  no one can tell me if IÕm not beautiful because as long as I love my self and believe in myself, I am perfect. ","100575277"

I have recently begun to hold to the belief that no matter how much of a struggle it is to get over an obstacle, whether a personal problem or school work, as long as you believe you will make it through; nothing can stop you. Thought is the very first step to an accomplishment in any situation. There are times when it can be difficult to believe in yourself and your skills but you will never know what you can do until you try with all your energy and will. I have had moments where my anxiety over certain tasks has kept me from opportunities and I have told myself over and over from those days Òno more.Ó No more doubting whether I can make it. No more doubting my own judgement. No more relying on other people to confirm if I am right or wrong. I am my own person and only I can be me.
In psychology, they termed this the self-fulfilling destiny.Ó It is when a person believes they can attain something and then they work until they make the belief true. Of course it is easier to commit to a task when you are not weighed down by believing you will fail before you begin. How could you ever accomplish something when you think from the start there is no way for you to do so? Each person gets to decide what their limits are, so why would you ever want to create those limitations before you have ever tried anything? It can be that the mindset a person chooses for him or herself that is the determining factor in their success or failure. 
I struggled with this terribly in high school, specifically with Chemistry. No matter what I tried I simply could not follow the teacher and his way of giving instructions. I began to believe I could never do will in Chemistry and my D average reflected that mindset. Doing so terribly in the class even made me doubt what I had always planned to do with my life, go into a science field. Halfway through the year though I switched teachers in a last ditch effort to salvage something of the grade; even if I still did not get the material. The new teacher I had, however, was dedicated to having her students understand everything they were taught. Dr. Savery made me believe in my own ability again and my grade in her class quickly flipped around to AÕs. She showed me the importance of not giving up or degrading my own efforts as futile. She is the one that has shaped my beliefs as well as renewing the belief in myself and my skills in science courses.","100603025"

I believe that opportunity is for those who want it. If you want something, you have to work hard for it or that opportunity will be gone. Coming from an Asian family, both my parents would constantly tell me to study and take advantage of the opportunities they never had. I remember asking them why they moved to America for a school assignment. They always spoke of the opportunities that America provides however, those opportunities did not come free. Everything up to this point in my parents' lives was because of hard work. They also know not everyone has an equal opportunity here in America. They stressed that I had to be one of the best in order for people to hire me. My parents meant that although there were all types of people in America, they knew that Caucasians would have the greatest chance at finding jobs and opportunities. If I show laziness during my studies, I may as well throw away the opportunities that my parents offered me by coming to America.
From as long as I can remember, my father has always had pains somewhere on his body. These pains were due to overexertion during work. My father has always worked at a restaurant as a chef ever since he came to America. He always came home saying, “Oh son, look at the burns on my hands. If you don't want to work the job I have, then you must study diligently.” Back in China, my dad worked as a banker. He graduated from high school with good math skills and went straight to banking. He often reflects about how in China, he had to climb a hill in order to borrow a single book from the library. He marvels that it is so much easier for kids like me nowadays.
My parents came to America in order to give me a better opportunity. In school, I have learned to develop my reading, writing, and speaking skills in English. By doing this, I have become a great asset to my parents who are unable to read or speak English efficiently. I was able to read the bills, interpret important health insurance documents, and translate conversations. I have accompanied my father to so many doctor appointments over the past few years for various issues. I would interpret whatever the doctors had to say to the best of my abilities and tell my father about the conditions he had.
Working as a chef in a Chinese restaurant is a extremely hard job. My father has been working as a chef for different Chinese restaurants for as long as I can remember and therefore has strained and hurt himself many times over the years. His work ranges from cooking food while battling scorching oils to lifting cumbersome shipments of raw meat. I remember trying my best to translate the words the doctor had said. My father had a case of carpal tunnel that could prevent him from working if it wasn't taken care of. He also needed physical therapy in the lumbar region of his body. My father insisted that he should continue to work even under these circumstances because he did not have health insurance making the treatment very costly. My mother talked to him and asked him to think rationally because this all of our lives. Eventually my father agreed to take the therapy. Without the support of my father, our household would crumble, and I would have to split my focus from school into finding a job in order to support the rest of the family.
Opportunity is something not everyone has. My parents came to America in order to seek a better life for me. They want me to develop myself both in academics and as a person. Being reminded constantly to study in order to become what I want to be has driven me forward and has shaped the person I have become today. My parents' struggles and sacrifices inspire me to take advantage of the many opportunities they have given me.

I, like many other people in this world, have very similar or different beliefs. Like the belief that a lot of school work can be very difficult, pertains to students. Coming off from that tangent, it does lead me to reveal one of my biggest beliefs; That the events that happen in a person’s life does affect how their future is going to hold. Similar to saying “everything happens for a reason”. Yes, this may be cliche and many people have talked about this but I do truly believe that something out there is making certain events occur which can greatly affect a person. I am not an avid religion practice so I think many things happen through coincidence but I always wonder ‘if I didn’t do this at a certain time I may not be here’. This all sounds very abstract but I think my story will better reveal my thoughts.
This story is nerdy and a little odd but it has affected my life significantly. A few years back I played on the Xbox 360. I started playing because of my brother when I was much younger and once, he moved on to college, I took it over. I would play the usual shoot them up and sport games. It was the summer going into my junior year and I had been playing on it more frequently since I had no school. This was also the time when I was beginning to think about colleges. One evening I was playing a game called “Call of Duty”-- this is one of the shooter games. I was playing online, which means I was playing with or against actual people from all over the United State. While playing online some people use headsets or a microphone so they can talk to one another. I don’t usually talk online but that evening I wanted to. As I was waiting for the game to begin, I was in an open lobby where anybody within that game can hear someone speak. I heard a girl’s voice, which is not common, so I said hey back. We started talking and eventually we became online friends; We would chat and play together. I learned that she was my age and was also looking for colleges. She told me that she was looking at the University of Rhode Island because of the Pharmacy program. I thought it was interesting, I had never thought about URI but I told her that it must be a great choice if it is known for that. As junior year went by, I only heard about URI once more from another person and from the original girl, with more information. I had been applying more south because of where the colleges were geographically but I looked into URI spontaneously one day because my friend, from Xbox, had kept talking about it. I learned that they had a well-known marine biology program and I actually knew a few people who went for that program. On the day before the application was due, I decided, ‘why not? It’s on common app. So, the process won’t be too difficult and I would just have to pay the rush fees for my ACT score’. I applied, got in, and when I visited, I fell in love with it and I am very happy with the decision I made. All I can say is that I am very happy that I was able to meet this girl because she basically opened up this opportunity for me. I think, 'wow if I never had a mic in that may never have happened'.","100000078"

As cliche as it might sound, something that I strongly believe in is Karma, it’s a real thing. The idea of treating someone the way that you want to be treated has been beaten into our minds since we just a child in Kindergarten. If you broke little Johnny’s favorite toy, you could only expect that he would do the same to you, but if you shared your snacks with him at your snack time, he would probably end up sharing his too...unless he’s like me, and sharing snacks isn’t even an option. Sometimes people tend to forget this concept, and think that they can say or do whatever they want without thinking how other people would feel about it. But an event that once happened to me in high school never fails to remind me that karma, and treating people the way that YOU want to be treated is in fact a real thing.
Growing up with a mentally ill brother can be a struggle that some people just do not understand, I mean how could they if they were never exposed to it? My brother Corey is 33 years old, that’s 15 years older than me to save you from trying to figure out the math. He was born normal my mom says, like every teenage boy he rode bikes, played football and went to the school dances, but around 18 is when my mom noticed a change in his behavior. Corey started acting out, drinking, smoking, and doing other drugs that my mom had no idea about, and eventually he dropped out of high school, getting his GED and leaving my home. What my mom didn’t know was why he was acting out. 
About 8 years later my brother returned home, to get help. Corey was diagnosed with severe Paranoia Schizophrenia. The doctors said this is why he was acting out, because the “voices” were telling him what to do, and he was trying to self-medicate because he was too afraid to tell anyone. So, as you might know someone with such a serious mental illness does not always look or act like everyone else. To me my brother is just my brother, I love him and always will no matter what he is going through, but other people do not always realize that he’s not weird or on drugs, he is sick and this happens a lot in public. An incident that really angered me was last year, Corey had gotten in a car with one of his “friends” and they were going to go hang out with other people, so while driving on the highway his friend was driving like a “nut bag” as he would say, so he made him let him out of the car. In the middle of the highway, smart right? Well, what he didn’t know was that he was almost in Connecticut, and it was 10 at night. So, not knowing where he was, he called my mom and she told him to call the police station for them to come get him because they could use his gps on his phone to find him. Well, when the Policemen got there, they were not professional or kind at all, they kept interrogating him trying to say that he was on drugs, and they need to arrest him for “being on narcotics”. Now, i only know this for a fact because he had them on speakerphone and they talked to my mom. Well, the crazy lady that my mom is, was very angry and wrote a letter to their chief saying that they need training on how to deal with mentally ill people in the community, and well now they had a station wide meeting about how to deal with the mentally ill.
So, I believe that if you are going to treat someone like they are less than you then karma is going to come back and bite you in the butt. If they had treated Corey like a real person, they would not have had to sit through that long class.","100576835"

I am confused by the wording of the assignment.  By Òmy beliefsÓ IÕm not sure if that means my religious beliefs, my philosophy, or my core values.  The first thing that comes to mind is that I believe in myself, and life is too short so I gotta stay positive, enjoy the moment and not let people or events bring me down.  
My core beliefs come from where I grew up, in a secluded house surrounded by woods in Chepachet, Rhode Island. Though out my whole life IÕve always felt a connection to the woods. Always exploring and hiking, I became an eagle scout in my local boy scout troop because I enjoy camping and nature a lot.   Senior year of high school I wrote a short film called ÒWoods BoyÓ about me living in the woods and surviving and such.  Nature is one of my big beliefs, and that influenced me choosing Environmental Management as my major.  
Other core beliefs come my home life of course.  IÕm close with my two siblings, I have two sisters, and IÕm the middle child.  To my parents IÕve always felt like I was stuck in-between my sisters. My older sister was first for everything and my younger sister gets whatever she wants.  So really thatÕs how I learned to not worry about what happens in life and just go with what I canÕt control.  The one most important thing my mother ever taught me was always try my hardest and that what happens, happens.  
My older sister was sent to a Catholic high school when she became a freshman, so my parents sent me there too my freshman year.  I was raised Catholic, but as I went through high school taking religion classes every day. I decided to leave the church because I didnÕt agree with it.  I still graduated from that Catholic high school, but my choice to not practice that religion any more has affected my family life. ItÕs hard to get into the details, but I am not close with my mother anymore because of that and a few other life choices.  Another one of my core beliefs is kinda selfish, but I believe that I have to live for myself and believe in myself to make myself happy before others, which is a core satanic belief.  
What I believe is a really important area of my life is my involvement in music.  I taught myself how to play the electric guitar over the past three years, by listening to heavy metal music daily and putting in a lot of effort to practice at least two hours each day, sometimes all day.  My best friend Mitch is a drummer who shares the same belief as me.  Everyone needs a hobby, and creating loud music is our hobby.  Heavy metal is such a big part of my life that I would consider it my religion, and I would say that the best moment of my life was when I got to perform with my band in front of my whole school. Over all I donÕt have a specific belief but if I had to choose what is most important to me I would say my family, my music, nature and myself.

Work hard be a role model, have fun, have an opinion, always expect the unexpected. These are phrases that I have come to believe are guidelines for my overall happiness and success as a person. I have played hockey for most of my life, and the reason I have stuck with it for so long is because I always have a ton of fun when I am on the ice (well, except for when we are doing conditioning). Skating around the rink is exhilarating, and scoring a goal, in an important game especially, is the greatest feeling in the world. But like anything, whether it be school or painting or woodworking, being a good hockey player does not happen overnight. It takes years of literal blood, sweat, and tears to become a master. My parents are both extremely hard-working people; and seeing how much time and effort they put into their work motivated me to do the same in hockey.
The reason I combined working hard with being a role model is I believe in leading by example. If somebody is in charge of a group project, and is constantly telling other members of a group how and when to do things, but that person doesn’t seem to know how or simply not want to put in the effort himself, how can he be considered a leader? It would seem as if he is unfit for being in charge. On the other hand, a leader who knows what he is doing and is able to give constructive criticism on what or what not to do in a certain situation is worth listening to in my eyes. Leaders are people who put in more work than is expected of them at all times, even when some of that work goes unnoticed. Leaders cannot be leaders for the wrong reasons; they must be selfless. If you genuinely work hard at something, then you will see results. That is the point when whatever it is you are working for becomes fun. 
Some people say that winning isn’t everything, and that’s true in some aspects. Sometimes losing is the best reminder of what winning feels like, but 9 times out of 10 you will not hear somebody say that they had a better time losing a game or failing a test than they did winning or passing. It just doesn’t happen. Putting winning and losing aside though, if you don’t thoroughly enjoy doing whatever it is you are doing, then nothing matters. The reason I stuck with hockey for so long while I watched most of my friends, I grew up with stop playing over the years, is that I truly love to play the game. There have been countless times where I have been ready to give it all up and quit, but I had a goal to play college hockey and if I had quit, I would not have achieved that goal.","100000080"

I believe in simple acts of kindness, not just because it’s good to be a nice person but because you can very easily change someone’s life with something as basic as a smile and never even realize that you made an impact. I discovered the true effects of kindness only a few months ago on my high school’s senior retreat. I went to an all-girl’s catholic high school in Los Angeles and it was a truly amazing place. You’d walk on campus and see so many different kinds of people. I definitely didn’t know everyone in my grade, even though my school wasn’t huge, but everyone knew Oliver. He is one of quite a few transgender students that is/was a student at Immaculate Heart and he was probably one of the kindest people on campus. I wasn’t very close with him for the majority of my time at Immaculate Heart but we ran in similar circles so whenever I’d see him on campus, I would say hi or smile and wave. I didn’t really think much about it at the time because I knew a lot of people on campus between classes, soccer and clubs but I soon found out the true impact my actions had on him. As I said, Oliver was one of the kindest people on campus, but he was also one of the saddest. He struggled with depression and anxiety all throughout high school and his family did not support his transition at all which placed a lot of pressure on him to be someone he wasn’t. While I had heard about these issues in passing from friends it wasn’t until Kairos (our senior retreat) when Oliver told me everything himself, including showing me scars and opening up about a lot of personal information, and then went on to thank me for always making him feel wanted on campus. I was absolutely shocked and asked him what he meant seeing as we rarely exchanged more than a few words on any given day and he explained that every time I waved or yelled greetings to him across the hall it would brighten his day and make him feel like he mattered to someone that really had no motive to care about him. It took a while for everything he was saying to register with me but when it did, I began to think about how our small actions, which we don’t even think about, can be the difference in someone’s day, week month, year or life. It doesn’t have to be a huge gesture or an unforgettable moment, it’s as simple as validating the existence of another human being regardless of whether or not you know them. Now Oliver is one of my closest friends and it all started with a smile in the hallway. This experience showed me that kindness changes live in so many ways and that it’s really the little things that count. I believe simple act of kindness can be the difference maker for you or your peers and I try to live by this belief every single day and to the best of my ability.

Beliefs are something everyone has: It is truly something that makes a person unique. These beliefs very from person to person, culture to culture. My personal beliefs are quite simple - I believe that you can only learn and improve by first making mistakes. 
In my lifetime I have learned so many things. But before I learned those things, I needed to first make the mistake then make the correction. I obviously didn’t come into the world knowing everything that I need to know, if I did, I don’t think I would be enrolled in college here. All of my mistakes and all of the lessons I learn from them have given me tons of life experience and even helps build bonds with others. 
My overall belief is mainly based of my history of playing baseball. Playing this sport has helped me grow up in many ways and has taught me many things. I learned that it ok to fail and that I will have an opportunity to make adjustments and try again next time. I expect to fail only to come back stronger next time where I will succeed making that success that much better. My beliefs make me the man I am today and I’m proud of what I have accomplished. My beliefs gave me a strong work ethic and a drive to succeed in situations where I am expected to fail. 
Failure is a part of life. I believe one should correct it not dwell it. I never accepted failure and I don’t believe anyone should. I believe most people have the drive to correct themselves and improve. One needs to fall before they can pick themselves up and the more you fall the quicker you learn to pick yourself up faster. That is my belief.

One belief that I have always had throughout my whole life is that if you spread positivity it will benefit you mentally. I think if you go about your day being positive to everyone around you that you will be a happier person. I enjoy spreading positivity because it makes me feel better as a person knowing I can make people smile and laugh. I try to make people laugh because you never know how their day is going and that one laugh that I caused could be the thing that changes their day around. Sometimes if you’re having a bad day a good joke or comment that makes you laugh is all you need to keep you going. I also believe that if I spread positivity that when I need positivity karma will help me out by making me happy. I tend to not focus on the negative aspects of life because if you go through your life only thinking of negative things you will not see all the positive things around you. People who focus and worry about negative things will miss all the good opportunities that life has to offer and they will just remain miserable. When I start to think about negative things I surround myself with people who make me smile and laugh and the bad thoughts fade away in my head. I think that a good smile or laugh is enough to help you power through a tough day or a tough time in your life. I feel like no matter what the situation is that there is a positive aspect about it that is not usually seen when someone is upset. I enjoy giving people advice who are upset because I look at the situation through a different mindset and offer an insight they may not have realized. I help the people find a positive aspect about their situation and help them understand how much they have in their life. When I get sad or upset, I like to think about everything that I have and how fortunate I am to have my life. I have had a pretty rough childhood with my parent’s divorce and trouble with the law so I think I have a pretty good understanding of some aspects of life. I have learned from all the mistakes I have made and without those mistakes I would not be the person I am today. I think that getting in trouble so much has changed my mindset and makes me think more positive about my life and other peoples. Since I had such a rough time with high school I enjoy helping others with their problems because I have been in similar situations and it always feels good to have someone there for you when you need it. I would like to be the person people come too when they are upset or having issues because I actually enjoy giving people advice and helping them realize all the positive things that they have in their lives. I promote positive thinking and try to have an open mind about everything because I feel like it makes me more understanding. When someone has an issue and needs to talk to someone, I would like to be there for them because I remember when I had nobody I could talk too and it was very difficult for me. When people explain their problems to me I put myself in their shoes and try to look at the situation through their perspective. My main belief is to spread positivity to as many people as you can because you never know how that could impact their day or how they are feeling. There are no negative aspects about spreading positivity the only thing that can come out of it is making other people happy there are no downsides.   ","100000083"

When I took my entrance exam for Classical High School, I was given a choice, what language did I want to study? There were little boxes for Spanish, Italian, Latin, French and Japanese. The idea of taking Spanish, my parents’ native tongue, just did not seem to excite me. Although I can speak Spanish, and misgender everything, I did not know how to really read or write, so essentially, I would be starting from square one. With Latin, my middle school only offered Latin and I had neutral feelings towards it. I ended up deciding that I wanted to try something new, I was already into manga and anime so I figured why not learn Japanese?
Taking Japanese is still handing down the best decision I have ever made. I took it all four years in high school and learned so many things that I thought I would never learn in a high school course. We threw in class parties and made traditional dishes to try, we would hose festivals and dress up. Luckily in my first-year Japanese high school students were coming to visit and needed host families to stay with, and my parents were onboard with the idea. I went from being an only child who spoke barely any Japanese, to having to Japanese sisters who barely spoke English, and despite the language barrier we had a blast. In volunteering to host as a freshman, I unknowingly secured myself a spot on a government paid trip to Japan. I was in my second year when my teacher told me that she had five spots left for what was supposed to be for third and fourth year only students. It was two weeks before the departure date, I went and told my parents I was going, regardless of how they felt. I knew an opportunity like that happens once and a lifetime and I wasn't going to let it go past me. 
      I finally got to see the country that I invested a lot of time into learning about, I stayed with a family, went to a high school, and saw endless gorgeous temples. When I returned home, I decided that no matter how hard Japanese gets it was something I wanted to continue studying, for the rest of my life. I’ve hosted five girls, and have been in contact with nearly all of them despite having only meeting them for a brief period of time. I love my sisters and my motivation to improve my Japanese, I want to be able to go back and thank them for letting me host them, thank their families for trusting their child to an American family they never met, and for teaching me an invaluable lesson of understanding and embracing different cultures.
      If I do not make it as a wildlife and conservation biology major, I know I can do something with my Japanese. I believe that if I had not taken the chance of taking a language out of my comfort zone, I would not have the unbelievable experiences, friends, and connections I have today. I believe everyone should do something unique and special to them, despite what people say. If you are passionate about it, go for it. You will be rewarded in so many different ways. It is hard to think about what would high school, interests, and life now would be like if I had not taken that chance. I would not be where I am today without my parents unwavering support and my Sensei Ms. Morimura.

I believe in fate. I love the idea that there is a greater power beyond a person’s control. I
am here right now because this is where I am supposed to be. Everything happens for a reason.
I am a sophomore here at URI and ever since my senior year of high school I have been stressing about what to choose for my major. I entered my freshman year with a nursing major, and in that one year, I have never learned so much about myself and others. I had classes that were much more difficult than any high school course, I finally had freedom from my parents, and I had two roommates with completely different interests than me. Naturally it was a scary first semester but I embraced the challenges.
Anatomy was shockingly harder than I thought it’d be. I’ve never worked so hard for anything in my life than I did in this class. I loved learning about the body and if I hadn’t been so fascinated by it, I never would have succeeded. I continued through general chemistry, physiology, organic chemistry, and at the end of the school year was proud of my achievements. However, I felt like I was headed in the wrong direction. I doubted nursing as my future career, and after shadowing in the ICU, I knew for a fact that nursing was not for me. So, I trusted me
gut and decided to try out kinesiology in the fall. For fun, I signed up for an education course. Now I am almost midway through my fall semester and I have decided that I want to be an elementary school teacher. The EDC 102 course I enrolled in by chance lead me to my real passion: teaching.
The freedom I was exposed to when my parents said goodbye to me in my dorm was both exciting and overwhelming. I made new friends fast and started partying like a wild child. My first year of freedom is full of funny stories, great people, and mistakes I’ve learned from.
Regardless, I’ve learned about real friendship, trust, and how do handle a variety or social situations and predicaments. Some of the people I met stayed in my life and some haven’t, but I know that all of them came into my life for a reason.
My roommate situation first semester was close to that of a nightmare. At first, I just asked myself “why me?”. One of them was on the rugby team and never cleaned up after herself. The other one was on the student council and very shy. The three of us were opposites. But after a couple weeks of weeks of getting to know them better I began to become open minded. We all got along and learned to live with each other just fine. Having roommates that were very different from me helped me to learn how to work with other kinds of people. In the real world, it’s close to impossible to like everyone. From living with these girls, I learned that despite our differences we can all still get along. It’s an important character trait to be able to work with other people. I believe that I was roommates with them so that I could learn this lesson.
I believe in fate. I love the idea that there is a greater power beyond a person’s control. I

I foster kittens and puppies for my local animal shelter that I have worked at for the past 4 years. 
This was the first time I was taking care of a very small orphaned kitten that required bottle feeding and around the clock attention. She was an orange, black, and white calico. She weighed 8 ounces when I took her home that first day. She fit in the palm of my hand. I had to feed her every two hours. I would wake up at 12 am, 2am, 4am, and 6am to mix the KMR and warm water. Then I’d have to heat it up by placing the bottle in a bowl of warm water until the milk was within 4 degrees of 102. Then I would swaddle her and feed her until she wouldn’t take the bottle any more. I’d replace her heating pad every three hours. I would walk around the house with her sleeping in the nook of my arm. I would help her as she was learning to walk. I fell in love with this little kitten during the first two weeks taking care of her. She was my baby. I remember going home after prom and feeding her before even getting changed. I remember bringing her with me when I was babysitting late so I could feed her while the kids slept. 
Then one night she would not take the bottle at 8pm. Then she wouldn’t take it at 11pm or 2am. It was normal for her to once and a while skip a feeding or not show interest in the bottle but around 2am it was different. Then 5am when I tried again she had something that seemed like a seizure. She was very hot and just started shaking. This tiny now 17-ounce kitten was shaking so much. Her bowels released. I switched the blanket I was holding her with and placed a small ice pack in between the layers to cool her down a bit. She stopped shaking. She was rigid. Her eyes were half open. She seemed gone, but you could still feel her heart. I contacted the shelter director who would be able to get there in an hour. She had me place corn syrup on a cotton swab and rub it on her gums and tongue in case it was a hypoglycemic episode, which in this case it was. I just sat at the kitchen counter for the next hour holding her out in front of me in a blanket as I gently rubbed my fingers on her back to stimulate her sensory nervous system. The only thing that was there was a heartbeat. That hour seemed to last forever, and though I hated to think it I thought she was gone. I thought there was no way she could come back. Finally, the shelter director arrived around 6:30am and took her to the shelter’s vet tech room and placed her on a drip. I thought I wouldn’t hold her again at least while she had a heartbeat. I just wanted to hear how she was doing. I was just waiting to hear she was gone. 
Finally, I got a call. 
She was moving around. She was mewing. She was taking the bottle. She would be fine and I could pick her up whenever that afternoon. So I did, and it still ceases to amaze she made it through when it seemed so hopeless in that hour of holding her when there was just a heartbeat. 
Thus my main belief is the consequences of an event or action are never truly known or determined until time has passed; only then may your fears be affirmed or contradicted. 
Because in the end she made it. Maisie made it. I no longer allow myself to be inherently negative, but I am unable to be inherently positive so the least I can be within reason is hopeful.

I enjoy spending time with my family. I believe that family is very important to everyone.  This can be as simple as were all in a car driving somewhere or hanging out together eating dinner. A quote that I also believe that can relate to me and my family is a quote written by Kurt Vonnegut. The quote is, “Enjoy the little things in life for one day you’ll look back and realize they were the big things”. I think that this quote explains how me and my family are around one another. I come from a big family where my uncles and aunts were born in Dominican Republic. They all enjoy visiting Dominican Republic during the summer to see family members they haven’t seen all year. They had gifts to give them and was looking to spend time together. 
Last summer all my uncles, aunts and my family decided to take a group vacation to Dominican Republic. Before going we found out that my uncle was very ill. Since we knew he was ill he took precaution on the this we did but still tried to do activities he could participate in. At that time, I tried not to think of it too much, and  was thinking he will get better soon with doctors. This wasn’t the case he soon ended up passing away not too long this spring. When I look back to our vacation, I can remember doing all of the fun things with him. One is example was when he called some of his friends over and called us to come. His friends started to perform for us by singing and dancing. This was a big thing because my uncle always tried to keep things positive. Even though he was hurting on the inside he would have a smile on his face. Another thing is that he never liked being left behind. This was a little thing at first that then we all realized was big. He didn’t like being left behind because it would make him feel depressed. So, to make it feel better we would try including him in all the tasks we did like going to the beach, river, seeing performances. 
Finally, what I’m trying to explain is that when I look back at all these memories, I can see that all the little things we did for him were actually big this that meant a lot to him. Family are the people who care the most about you whenever. Even if you do something good/bad are sick or healthy they're always around. During that time, I was with my family I enjoyed every day being there. People now in days are always on their phones. When they got somewhere new, they are always taking pictures sending messages and posting things and they don’t value what their seeing completely. When I went to visit, I was in a new environment without technology and actually having to talk to people face to face rather than on a phone. This showed me a different insight into capturing the moments I was living.  I had lots of good laughs like seeing my little cousins chase chickens around, to seeing my mom and aunt push each other into a pool. This is why I believe that family is important and that we should  enjoy little things in life because when you look back to them, they are actually big things.

Let’s All Just be Equal. I believe that everyone on this planet is equal. I am a strong activist for the LGBTQ+ community, the Feminist community and any other group that wants everyone to be equal, I will fight for. I have feminist beliefs because my mother and grandmother are both strong feminists. We believe that women are equal to men in every way, and therefore women should be treated equally. Women should not be paid less just because they are women, women should be allowed to go on maternity leave without being penalized and women should have a right to their own body. Women should be allowed to dress as they want without being judged. We should stop judging the victims, but instead protect the victim and immediately blame the one causing the pain. The whole idea of blaming the victim blows my mind, along with the idea that women make only 3/4th of what men make within the same job. I also am a feminist because we need more strong women in the world. There are not many women in the science and math fields, and I wish to break down those walls. I will become a Marine Biologist one day and I will work beside both men and women to help make our environment a better place. Now, I would like to clarify that I do not hate men. I simply believe that men should step aside a bit and make room for women because we are smart too and it’s time for men to no longer be in charge. We need women in leadership rolls, we need women in science, we need women activists. Honestly, we just need women to feel comfortable with their life and not feel like they have to stay at home all the time like the perfect ‘housewife’. Not to say that they can’t be, but they just should not feel that they have to. good.
      I am also a strong believer that people should be allowed to love who they love. I know several people within the LGBTQ+ community and there is no difference between them and everyone else. They still love the same way, can get hurt the same way, and have feelings, just like everyone else. Many couples that are within this community are discriminated against. They have a harder time getting jobs, making friends, and sometimes they have a harder time in school because of the way they are made fun of. So many people in this community decide to kill themselves because they feel that no one will ever accept them. I find that the saddest and horrible thing, and that is why I fight for their rights. Of course they should allow to marry. I can’t believe that was ever even a question. Just because they don’t necessarily follow your beliefs, does not mean that you can tell them what they can and can’t do. To be honest this entire essay does not really have one set belief, it is more my ranting about how wrong it is for people to be treated badly just because they are ‘different’. We must remember as a society that everyone is equal, we are all just human, and therefore we should not treat each other differently just because of their gender, sexual orientation or skin color.","100000088"

The saying “everything evens out” is not just a saying, it is a fact of life.  Change in life is inevitable, and I believe that getting too high or too low on yourself is foolish.  If a significant other leave you, or you fail an exam, or whatever it may be, do not let it dictate the way you go about your day or how you live your life.  I believe that this is a great guiding principle for how to live, and it holds true for the emotional, social, and intellectual aspects of life.  
Keeping the saying “everything evens out” in mind when dealing with everyday social and emotional situations is extremely helpful.  If I am having a rough day emotionally, I try not to beat myself up over it or let it affect how I interact with others, because I know that the next day will be completely different for me and the emotions will even out.  The same goes for interacting with others, whether it be friends, family, or a significant other.  Everyone is dealing with their own personal conflicts, and I try to always keep this in mind when having a conversation with a friend or whoever it may be.  A person could act a certain way towards you one day, and then act completely differently the next; it all evens out.  The aspect that I try to be the most conscious of is the quality and healthiness of a relationship that I have with a person.  If I can express myself and truly be myself around a person, that is a healthy relationship.  From a relationship aspect, if I feel as though my significant other is dictating the way I feel in a negative way or causing me stress, I break it off.  It is simply not a healthy way to live life.    
The prevalence of social media has also greatly influenced how people perceive the world.  Social media gives the illusion that everyone’s life is a series of extreme highs and extreme lows.  In reality, this is not the case.  Everyone experiences highs and lows; they are simply a part of life.  What matters is how a person balances out these highs and lows and how the ride that is life goes for them in the long run.  That is what dictates the quality of a person’s life.  Getting too high on yourself just makes the lows that much worse, and getting too low on yourself is unhealthy because nothing ever stays constant in life and things will improve.  
I believe that living by the saying “everything evens out” is an extremely effective approach to life.  In no way am I inferring that a person should not work hard or make bad life choices because “everything evens out”.  Our lives are constantly changing, and becoming fixated on one aspect or relationship just because of the way it makes you feel, whether it is positive or negative, is not a healthy approach to life.

Something that I believe to be true is that no matter what obstacle is put in front of you, or how bad any situation is, there will always be something or someone to help you through. To back up my belief I chose three examples with stories to them. The first example is schoolwork. Anyone can tell you that transitioning from high school to college is one of the hardest things a new college student could go through. The work is a lot different, a lot harder, and overall you just have to be a more independent person. This example can relate to me because I have been having a really hard time with my classes and struggling to keep up with the work. So to help me with this struggle, I will go to SI sessions, read chapters over, or study and work with other people to get a different view on ideas. It definitely does not make the work 1000 times easier and make it so that I can fly through the homework. But it does help and it does give me a better understanding of what a morning. Now that IÕm a little less stressed it makes completing my work easier and makes me a happier person and I feel productive. My second example is social life. This one isn't as severe as schoolwork, but it still does have an impact on someone's life. My backstory is I tend to be a shy person and I tend to keep to myself. That's how I've been my whole life and it's just what I find more comfortable for me. But I want to step outside my comfort zone and get to know more people and become more social. So in high school I decided to join some sports teams and clubs to help me get to know the people around me. Going into college is a lot harder because you have to make completely new friends. So I decided to join a club, the outing club, and a sorority to help me. I can say that this was the best I can say that this was the best decision of my life because it made the transition a lot easier, decision of my life because it made the transition a lot easier, and I am never bored.  My last example is relationship issues. For this example I actually have a pretty recent story. For the past couple of weeks I have been having roommate issues. My roommate and I are so similar that we butt heads too often. So lately we've been getting into a lot of fights to the point where we call each other harsh things, she's made me cry, etc. I feel that relationship issues really plays a big factor on your overall work outcome and your social life too. Because if you're going through relationship issues your mind is in another place and you're distracted from other things around you. So to overcome this obstacle I decided one, to toughen up be the bigger person, and two, vent to my best friend. So I stopped retaliating with my roommate and told her that we're living together, and as adults should be civil towards each other whether or not we necessarily like each other. And instead of fighting with her further I vented everything I needed to my best friend. It helped me get out my anger so I wouldn't take it out on my roommate. Overall, the main point is that no matter how bad things can get, there's always a supporting thing or person that can help you get through your problems. ","100596608"

Success. I believe success is measured by many different things, but the most important aspects are gratitude and happiness. Not how much money you make or what job you have or what society dictates. If I am not happy or I do not recognize the chances I’ve been given, I cannot consider myself successful. There are many aspects of success, more than I could ever begin to list. Overall, every experience contributes in its own special way.
I am only 19 and yet already I have changed my mind about what makes me happy hundreds if not thousands of times. In my freshman year of college, I changed my major three times until I finally found something, I am interested in. Or at least something I think I am interested in. I have the luxury of knowing my parents will be proud of me no matter what I choose, and for that I am eternally grateful. I know many people do not have that comfort and their “success” is dictated by others around them. Perhaps their parents are pushing them to go to med school or be an engineer, but I get to choose my own interests, which my parents understand is not any one thing. I am able to change my mind and find my own way in life, my own success, my own happiness. I can never thank my parents enough for the freedom they have given me. I believe gratitude is a large part of success.
I also love to travel, but with a purpose. I feel like being in one place for too long inhibits my ability to grow and learn about the world around me. I thrive on new experiences that challenge my thoughts and ideals. I travel with my dad every winter to a new place and every time I learn something new and am confronted with an aspect of humanity I hadn’t experienced before. In Greece this past winter my father and I came across a man from the Middle East who went home for a wedding and was stuck there for six months due to his ethnicity before being able to return to Greece. He watched friends and family get shot in front of him yet retold the story of his life to us as though we were now a part of his family. I could never imagine being in his shoes, but I felt a little more connected to him and humanity that day. 
I believe success is knowing you have a good life, and are happy with who you are, but it is also recognizing the fact that so many people do not have the opportunities you do. In order to be successful, you must also be compassionate, empathetic, and aware of the challenges facing humanity. If you cannot appreciate the fortune you have, how will you ever know your true happiness?
I strive to make an impact. All my life when asked what I plan to do with my life I responded “I plan to change the world.” In all seriousness, I do plan to change the world. It may not be on a large scale; it could simply be making a positive impact on someone else’s life. On the other hand, I could play a role in mitigating clean water issues that affect so much of the world. However, my ultimate plan is to be happy, and make every experience count. If I can manage that, I can call my life a great success.","100000090"

My father is a drug addict. I am a first-generation college student. Eight years ago, my mother mustered up the courage to tell her only child, me, a ten-year-old boy that her and my father were getting divorced. Her faint blue tears bellowed down her face , adding sporadic spots of deep maroon to the bright red couch. Her face in that moment expressed emotions of fear and pain that I will never forget. I could tell that her pain was deeper than just being cheated on by her husband. She feared the upcoming change in lifestyle would disrupt her ability to take care of me. For a number of years my mom was forced to support me by herself. She worked multiple jobs and did all she could to make sure that I was in a position to succeed. For many years I was without a father figure in my life. As my father battled addiction, my mom and I were forced to fend for ourselves.
I quickly had to become the man of the house .  Without a dad to teach me how to be one.
I don’t say all of this to make you feel bad for me. I know that everyone experiences hardship in their lives. Everyone comes from different circumstances and backgrounds. Fortunately, I had a mother who put food on the table and made sure I was doing well in school. The summer of 2010 my mom sent me to live with my grandparents. My grandfather , God Bless his soul, passed away from melanoma that October. Experiencing his digression was life changing for me. He was and to this day is the biggest role model in my life. He himself lived in poverty growing up and had to work his way up. He grinded to the grindstone every day for his family. Whenever I was materialistic my papa would tell me, “ Be grateful of what you have , because you never know who has it worse.” This stuck with me. Throughout my life in a broken household, I used this to get me through the tough times.
 It’s sad to see that in some culture children lack proper food, water, and healthcare. People in First World America fail to understand is that there is always someone in a worse situation than you. In Africa and other third world countries, children are lucky to receive a formal education.
For all these reasons I believe that it is important to place a high value on life. It is important to always be grateful of your life the opportunities that are placed in front of you. I also believe in the equality of opportunity . I believe everyone should have the same chances to be successful and accomplish their dreams. There are now nearly 8
Billion people living on planet earth. Although we are all so similar , there are some substantially large differences in opportunity, culture, and wealth. Unfortunately, In the United States and other countries there is a large gap between the rich and the poor. The wealthy get wealthier and the poor become poorer. Is this fair? As humans can we stand for a society that accepts this? I believe that the U.S. and the rest of the world is in need for more equality of opportunity. Be grateful of what you have, because you never know who has it worse","

I believe the two most valuable things you can do in life are working hard and being kind. Hard work and kindness are my core values because to me they are the most important tools to being happy and successful in life. They are also so close to me because they are two simple tasks that anyone can do at any time but at the same time it is something that took me many lessons to learn.
Hard work is the first and arguably the most important of these values to me. I put so much emphasis on having a good work ethic because it applies to all areas of life, anything you ever want if you work hard for it you can go get it. I attempt to carry this mentality into all aspects of my life whether it is in football, school, or just an activity I am doing for fun. I always set goals for myself and work as hard and as long as I need to attain that goal. This was not just something I started doing overnight though. My father was the one that instilled this good work ethic in me at a young age. As a blue-collar worker, I watched him go to work every morning and get home late every night doing hard manual labor all day to provide a great life for my family. Not only did he do the work every day but the times he brought me with him I saw the effort and care he put into all of his work. He showed me by example just how important hard work is to not just him and I but everyone.
Being kind is the second core value I live my life by. My junior year of high school my best friends’ mom who I was so close to I would consider a mother of my own took her own life. I was there for my best friend right away because I thought he would need me but in actuality I realized it was I who needed him. His mother had always been a large supporter of a nonprofit organization that sold necklaces and other items all with the same two words on them “Be Kind”. I always saw these words and thought I understood them but it was not until this all transpired that I really got it. I learned from my best friend not through words but action that being kind is about treating everyone and everything with the utmost respect and kindness that you have to offer. No matter who you think you know you will never know their full story and what goes on in their life so it is only right to be kind every moment you live. Every morning I wake up and put on the same necklace with these words on it because each time I look down I am reminded of its importance. 
Core values need to be something that you really embody and not just things you say you do but don’t. I know myself that I wake up each morning and give my full effort and express my kindness to everyone I know because that is all I can do. Each individual only has so much control in this world and if I work my hardest and treat everyone right, I am confident I did all in my power to make the world a better place.","100000092"

Many people have personal beliefs that shape them into the type of person they are. One of my personal beliefs is that if you work hard enough, success will be easily achieved. I took this personal belief very seriously around the time when I started high school. This specific time is where my personal belief turned out to be true when I ran an obstacle race known as a Spartan Race. The Spartan Race is a true test of physical strength boasting a ten-kilometer course with over twenty-five obstacles. I knew that I couldn’t just show up to this grand challenge without any preparation, so I had to work hard to ensure that I would be able to cross that finish line in one piece.
During the summer of 2012, I tried my best to meet the expectations to run this Spartan Race successfully. Me and my other friends, Zak and Justin, decided to start working on upper body strength and our cardio. We built up our cardio from running one mile for a workout up to four miles. I always avoided running, because I was always horrible at it. This was a huge improvement for me. Our strength increased as we lifted old dumbbells that were in our houses. We tried to get the most out of the time we had to train. By the end of summer, I felt very satisfied with my work. I could run farther than I ever have previously, and I could feel the difference in my strength and muscle mass. I was physically ready for this race, but I was terrified deep down that I won’t make it to the finish line.
When it was time to walk up to the starting line with Zak and Justin, I was more nervous than ever. I had ten kilometers and over twenty-five obstacles between me and the that finish line. I ran up and down the mountains of the course in the early September heat, my cardio training actually paid off. I lost my shirt around the halfway point as I continued to persevere. The obstacles were challenging, but surprisingly manageable. I had to lift heavy objects like logs and sandbags, I even had to climb uphill while carrying them. I had to crawl under barbwire for what seemed like forever, cutting and bruising my body in the process. I’ve had to use my upper body like never been able to do before. I’ve climbed up ropes and swung from monkey bars. I thought that I would never be able to do the things I did in that race. I’m proud to say that I only failed three obstacles, as I had to do only thirty “burpees” for each failed obstacle. As I thought the gauntlet of torment would never end, I saw the finish line. I powered through the group of “Gladiators” who guarded the finish line. They hit me with giant Q-tip staffs as I passed through the finish line.
Passing through that finish line was probably my greatest accomplishment at the time, as I have done what I thought was impossible. After committing to intense training, I was able to manage a monster of a challenge like the Spartan Race. I then believed that anything can be easily achieved if you train or persevere hard enough. I took this belief to heart as I did three more Spartan races later on and participated in winter track and lacrosse in high school.","100000093"

I have believed that if you really want something, you will get it with hard work or dedication. This may be kind of hard to hear from me because I am a huge slacker, however, the things I want I will get. This realization came to me in high school through sports and personal relationships. For example, I was new to the sports of football and wrestling, especially coming from a town with two really good teams. I remember being in middle school kind of going through the motions. However, when I reached my freshman year of high school, I was thrown into varsity wrestling, having never been on a varsity team in my life. Even though I was under experienced, I tried my best during the season, placing in some of my first tournaments ever. The next season however, I put in the work to get my varsity spot back, as well as to become a better wrestler. That season, I lost only 2 regular meet matches during the season and placed in many of the tournaments we participated in. Due to the work I put in, I was made team captain as a junior and easily became a contender in Rhode Island wrestling. Along with this story, I can also prove that putting in work will create success. I had a longtime girlfriend in high school, and she really didn’t like me much when we met. However, I kept being persistent over a few months, and she eventually started to like me more and more. In the end, we dated for a really long time and had a great relationship, almost like dating a best friend. If I were to pick any famous athlete or movie star or any other celebrity, their stories may be the same: they started from the bottom. Once the work is put in and you have in your mind that you can accomplish anything, you will see results you want. When I’m trying to get things that I want, I will do whatever I can to get to the top.","100000095"

The first thing that came to my mind when I was reading this assignment was my experiences working for a home health care company.  I’ve worked as a home health aide for this company for three years now, and it has been the best and worst experiences of my life.  So many stories came to my mind when I sat down to write this, but the most prominent one that fits this scenario would be when I ran into a situation in which I had to either obey my patient’s wishes, or call an ambulance.
I signed a contract when this company employed me that I would obey all the HIPAA laws, so there is not much about this scenario I can actually reveal.  This patient of mine is a functioning paraplegic, and on my very first day working with her she had me promise her that if she ever did not answer the door, to not call 911 and simply turn around a go home.  Initially, I promised her I would.  It was my first day on the job, and I of course wanted her to like me and feel comfortable around me, so I promised.  
I never realized that this promise was a bad thing until one day a few summers ago when she did not come and open the door for me when I rang the bell at the start of my shift.  The first thing I always do when a patient does not answer the door is call the office.  In this case, the office instructed me to keep ringing the bell and they would call her emergency contacts so I did as I was instructed.  A few minutes later they called back and told me the next thing to do would be to call 911, for she could be seriously injured and just unable to answer the door.  It occurred to me that my patient’s life could be at danger, so without even thinking I called 911.  An ambulance came and the EMT’s opened the door, and in fact my patient had fallen.  She was ok, and everything was fine, and in the end, she thanked me for not obeying her wishes and doing what I had to do to make sure she was ok.
When I think back on this story and why I acted as I did, I know that my personal belief definitely came into play.  I definitely put the care of others over my own, which is why I am a health studies major.  I knew that even if my patient would not be happy with my decision, that she would be healthy and okay.  I am not sure if this is simply how I was raised or how I was brought up to me, but I know for sure that this is what I believe and how I will always aim to live my life.  In life, one should always strive to do as they believe and not let what others say or do influence them in any way.

Core values are shaped through instances that happen in life. A major reason why things happen is because of choice. Every day I make choices that shape the outcome of the day. There are different paths that I can take and I choose the one that will benefit me the most. Sometimes I may have to make sacrifices in order to make others around me happy. But many times, I am not able to make a choice. There are occasions when something does not go my way, but I believe everything happens for a reason. I have experienced countless moments where I have chosen a path or been on a path that may not have been what I imagined. However, imaginations are only concepts and are not real. Not everything happens like it was first envisioned. 
In eighth grade I played three sports. I always gave it my all and I excelled in every single one of them. Then again, the following year I was going into high school and I knew I would not have enough time to play all three. I wanted to focus primarily on one sport but I was unsure on what direction to take. What I did know, was that I wanted to be really good at one sport and put forth all my effort into it. The three sports I played were football, baseball, and golf. I loved being on a team sport. There was nothing better than going out to eat with the team after a long game. I took every aspect into consideration. My dad played golf in college and could have turned professional. My brother played golf and baseball in high school and I thought about how much he enjoyed them both. My sister played golf and was a phenomenal player. When the time came at the end of eighth grade, I decided I wanted to play a team sport. I did not want to lose the friends I had in middle school. I wanted to feel comfortable and have relationships with people through the sport in high school. 
The summer going into high school was tough. I placed myself in as many baseball and football camps as possible to get a feel for both sports. I knew at the end of the day I was going to choose one of the two. My dad believed I could get a scholarship in either or if I continued to play it throughout high school. In the middle of the summer, I played in what would be my last baseball game ever. I broke my hand and could not play for the rest of the year. It was very hard on me to understand I would not be able to play.
My mom always told me it would all work out no matter what came my way. She would say to me “everything happens for a reason, my dear”. Through hard times, I seemed to really understand my surrounding environment. After my hand healed up, I played golf with my family and enjoyed the last of the days I had of summer. Those moments playing golf with family brought me closer to them and with the sport. My passion grew instantly. I began practicing harder than I ever had before. I realized that one day I want to play with my family when I am older. Golf is a sport I could play my whole life. I was tired of getting injured in football and baseball and I wanted to remain healthy. At the last second, I tried out for the high school golf team. I made varsity as a freshman and had a tremendous first season. 
Golf was not my first choice. It is a very independent sport and I would spend several hours of the day practicing by myself. The injury really set me back but I would always keep my mom’s words in the back of my head with whatever I did. Today, I am playing golf at the University of Rhode Island and I am receiving a great education. I could not be any more satisfied with where I am at. I continue to look at decisions I need to make carefully. But once I choose a direction I never look back. I take that route and know that everything happens for a reason.

I believe in treating others with respect no matter who they are. When I was younger, I watched some videos in my elementary school. The videos were about integrity and other such actions that people are expected to have. The videos were very cheesy now that I think about it. The videos said to ask if you want anything and say “please” or “thank you” when talking with others. The way the video projected things was very low key and easy to understand. Even though I was young I was able to get part of it although not all of it. The part that I got the most out of it was the music videos. After every episode the TV show would have a song at the end that was about what the episode went over. Just like the Bill Nye the science guy videos did. I think the most important part back then was the music videos I got to listen to. Now the most important thing from the videos was something they called the “golden rule” The golden rule in the video is “to treat others the way you want to be treated.”  So that became one of my core beliefs as I grew up. I want to respect people because I want to be respected in turn. I believe I can’t expect to be respected if I don’t try to respect others first. As I grew up, I learned about other problems the society I live has that has to do with respecting others. I was introduced into stereotypes. When I first had an in-depth discussion about it, I thought people were talking about types of stores that you can listen to. So, I started looking around the classroom for a stereo system. Obviously my looking around was in vain because stereotyping isn’t a physical thing, it is a psychological thing. I learned that day that there are people who fit into a certain type. I learned that almost every person is put into a metaphorical group that is arranged by one characteristic or multiple characteristics. I learned that people have judged a person just by looking at them. They put them into a group and put them down by saying unjust things. I learned that people see Americans as a group of fat people who do whatever they want. It was a real shock for me when I was in middle school. However, as I grew older, I saw other stereotypes that people produced. One group of people who used stereotypes and such were political cartoonists. They used stereotypes to make fun of other people who used them to put others down. I realized that even if some things are used to show negative stuff, I don’t have to follow the crowd. I found one of my core beliefs in an improved form. I thought that I would tell myself to think about people with integrity. I wouldn’t allow myself to treat people a certain way just because other people do it that way. So, I will say it once again. My core belief is that I will treat others with respect no matter what others say about this person.

Something I have believed above anything growing up has been that hard work is the key to success in any field. Anything is obtainable as long as the time is put into working towards that goal. If that goal is to learn how to play an instrument, the only way to become good at it is to practice. If someone wants to play at a high level for sports, they need to put the time into proper conditioning and nutrition along with plenty of practice time. The most common of all goals, success in academic fields, can be only achieved through study and research in their field. No person every obtained anything meaningful simply by looking at something. It takes a solid work ethic to become successful at something.
I always felt a work ethic is hard to maintain, but I know that when I put the work in, I will be successful. Anytime I failed a test, there was never a question about it. I knew the reason I failed was because I was lazy and did not study enough. Although I have done this more than I care to admit, there have been more occasions where I did work hard, and succeeded because of it. I play several instruments, but guitar is my most prominent. I have been playing since sixth grade, and it is only through countless hours of practicing that it became something I am proud of. Many late nights, and countless frustrations occurred in the process, but I overcame the adversity through hard work. I have spent several hours straight with a metronome working on one guitar riff over and over until I had it down perfectly. I find that many people give up on learning an instrument quickly because they see no progress. Learning an instrument requires time, it is not something that can be picked up overnight. If the effort and time was put in, they would get better at whatever instrument they are trying to learn.
A problem I find that people have is they lack finding the motivation to do something. I have struggled with school in the past because of a lack of motivation. I find that my own academic success has never been enough motivation for me to do well for whatever reason. I’ve always had to look to other things to motivate me to focus on my academic work. The end of my senior year was one of my strongest academic performances. My motivation? Not having to take any finals. I put the effort in, and managed to pull all A’s in some fairly tough courses. Musically my motivation has always been trying to keep up with my friends, who are extraordinary musicians in their own regards. I find that the most effective way to be hardworking is to have motivation to do the work.
I find that the only way to get anywhere is to work hard. Through hard work, anything can be accomplished. People who say they cannot do something, simply are not trying hard enough. My work ethic, while bad sometimes, is something I am incredibly proud of. It is what enables to do well in school, and eventually get me through engineering. It is for these reasons that I firmly believe that hard work is the key to success.","100000098"

I believe in people being treated properly and respectfully no matter what because we are all human beings. When I was about ten years old, my brother had social anxiety that took over his life and affected everyone around him, me especially. As little sisters do I look up to my older brother, but for this time in his life I grew more distant and became afraid. 
Becoming more afraid of him, made me scared to go home from school and I felt unsafe in my home. He had times where he lashed out and went crazy and put the well-being of me and my parents in jeopardy. I remember my parents hiding me behind laundry baskets full of clothes and putting blankets over me to make sure I would not get hurt. 
 The first time I went to visit my brother at Bradley Hospital I was scared and closed minded that anyone who went there was a bad person. My parents had to help me get the courage to walk through those doors. They said things like ""your brother would love to see you"" or ""it would make him feel better about this situation"". They got through to me and I went. The rooms were small and two people shared one room. Since I wasn't really aware of what a college dorm looked like back then I connected it to a jail cell. I felt that my brother did not deserve be separated from his family and that strangers would not help him.
Seeing how my brother was treated made me scared to grow up. I kept thinking what if I end up like him. The worse part about it was wherever we went people knew; when you come from a small town like Bristol everyone knows everyone's business. People would say horrible things about my brother with me three feet away from them. Then I came to the realization that they were wrong. He was not a bad person; they were bad people for talking about a fourteen-year-old. I realized I should not be afraid to be there for him. My family and I started going to therapy to help confront our feelings about everything. Since I was only ten, I sat there and listened to what everyone else said. Fully understanding how my brother felt made it easier for me to help him through this. I had to act normally as though nothing had changed. Over time he had gotten over his fear. His social anxiety was hardly noticeable, he is still shy in certain situations but he has overcome his biggest obstacle and I have become more open minded and aware of others. This led me to who I am today because I feel that I am a nonjudgmental person. You always hear that you do not know what other people are going through. This clicked in mind, I started not seeing people just who they were on the outside.  
This experience led me to realize that people who have some problems should not be sent away from loved ones. I became more open minded to the idea of not everyone is perfect, as I thought my brother was. People who have problems like this are looked down on by society, we should open our hearts and be compassionate and help them deal with the burden they have.  
To summarize I believe in that people should be treated as human beings and not treated differently or objectively based on something such as a mental illness or deformity. My brother was treated poorly by people we knew and judged. It opened my eyes that equality of all form such as race, gender, sex, and illness are all based on social standards. I have become a more caring and compassionate person because I believe in equality and being treated fairly. ","100000099"
